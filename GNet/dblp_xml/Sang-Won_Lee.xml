		<abstract>Summary: It is important to preprocess high-throughput data generated from mass spectrometry experiments in order to obtain a successful proteomics analysis. Outlier detection is an important preprocessing step. A naive outlier detection approach may miss many true outliers and instead select many non-outliers because of the heterogeneity of the variability observed commonly in high- throughput data. Because of this issue,</abstract>
