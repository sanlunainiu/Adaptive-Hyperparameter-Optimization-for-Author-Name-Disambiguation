		<abstract>Dissimilarity measurement plays a crucial role in content- based image retrieval, where data objects and queries are represented as vectors in high-dimensional content feature spaces. Given the large num- ber of dissimilarity measures that exist in many elds, a crucial research question arises: Is there a dependency, if yes, what is the dependency, of a dissimilarity measure's retrieval performance, on</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper presents an interactive content-based image re- trieval framework—uInteract, for delivering a novel four-factor user in- teraction model visually. The four-factor user interaction model is an interactive relevance feedback mechanism that we proposed, aiming to improve the interaction between users and the CBIR system and in turn users overall search experience. In this paper, we present how the frame-</abstract>

		<abstract>Dissimilarity measurement plays a crucial role in content- based image retrieval. In this paper, sixteen core dissimilarity measures are introduced and evaluated. We carry out a sys- tematic performance comparison on three image collections, including Corel, Getty and Trecvid2003, with seven differ- ent feature spaces. Two search scenarios are considered: sin- gle image queries based on Vector-Space-Model, and multi- image</abstract>

		<abstract>In order to bridge the &quot;Semantic gap&quot;, a number of relevance feedback (RF) mechanisms have been applied to content-based image re- trieval (CBIR). However current RF techniques in most existing CBIR systems still lack satisfactory user interaction although some work has been done to improve the interaction as well as the search accuracy. In this paper, we propose a four-factor</abstract>
