		<abstract>We present a new algorithm for scan registration of colored 3D point data which is an extension to the Normal Distributions Transform (NDT). The probabilistic approach of NDT is extended to a color-aware registration algorithm by modeling the point distributions as Gaussian mixture-models in color space. We discuss different point cloud registration techniques, as well as alternative variants of the</abstract>

		<abstract>We propose a new approach to appearance based loop detection from metric 3D maps, exploiting the NDT surface representation. Locations are described with feature histograms based on surface orientation and smoothness, and loop closure can be detected by matching feature histograms. We also present a quantitative performance evaluation using two real- world data sets, showing that the proposed method works</abstract>

		<abstract>To advance robotic science it is important to per- form experiments that can be replicated by other researchers to compare different methods. However, these comparisons tend to be biased, since re-implementations of reference methods often lack thoroughness and do not include the hands-on expe- rience obtained during the original development process. This paper presents a thorough comparison of 3D scan</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper presents a system for autonomous change detection with a security patrol robot. In an initial step a reference model of the environment is created and changes are then detected with respect to the reference model as differences in coloured 3D point clouds, which are obtained from a 3D laser range scanner and a CCD camera. The suggested approach</abstract>

		<abstract>Scan registration is an essential subtask when building maps based on range finder data from mobile robots. The problem is to deduce how the robot has moved between con- secutive scans, based on the shape of overlapping portions of the scans. This paper pre- sents a new algorithm for registration of 3D data. The algorithm is a generalization and improvement</abstract>
