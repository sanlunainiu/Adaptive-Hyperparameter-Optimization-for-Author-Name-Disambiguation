		<abstract>The design, development and operation of a network for the monitoring of the non- ionizing electromagnetic radiation in Greece is presented in this paper. Two independent sub-networks, called &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;pedion24&quot; have been operating since November 2002 in several areas, and more than 4,000,000 electric field strength measurements have been conducted to date. The measurement results indicate that the non-ionizing</abstract>
