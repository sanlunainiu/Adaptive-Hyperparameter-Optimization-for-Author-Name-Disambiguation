		<abstract>In this paper, a method is presented for detection of colonic polyps using both morphological and texture features of the colon wall from the abdominal computed tomography (CT) images. This method consists of two steps. In the first step, suspicious patches of the colon wall are quickly identified by utilizing special local and global geometrical information of the segmented inner-wall</abstract>

		<abstract>An automatic method has been developed for segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT) images for virtual colonoscopy obtained after a bowel preparation of a low-residue diet with ingested contrast solutions to enhance the image intensities of residual colonic materials. Removal of the enhanced materials was performed electronically by a computer algorithm. The method is a multistage approach that employs a</abstract>
