		<abstract>We introduce a new technique that can reduce any higher-order Markov random field with binary labels into a first-order one that has the same minima as the original. Moreover, we combine the reduction with the fusion-move and QPBO algorithms to optimize higher-order multi-label problems. While many vision problems today are formu- lated as energy minimization problems, they have mostly been</abstract>

		<abstract>In binocular stereo matching, points in left and right images are matched according to features that characterize each point and identify pairs of points. When one tries to use multiple features, a difficult problem is which feature, or combination of features, to use. Moreover, features are difficult to cross- normalize and so comparisons must take into account not only their</abstract>

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and &quot;meaningful&quot; region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding</abstract>

		<abstract>Binocular stereo is the process of obtaining depth information from a pair of left and right views of a scene. We present a new approach to compute the disparity map by solving a global optimization problem that models occlusions, discontinuities, and epipolar-line interac- tions. In the model, geometric constraints require every disparity discontinuity along the epipolar line in one eye</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract The representation of objects in images as tree structures is of great interest to vision, as they can represent artic- ulated objects such as people as well as other structured objects like arteries in human bodies, roads, circuit board patterns, etc. Tree structures are often related to the symme- try axis representation of shapes, which captures their local symmetries.</abstract>
