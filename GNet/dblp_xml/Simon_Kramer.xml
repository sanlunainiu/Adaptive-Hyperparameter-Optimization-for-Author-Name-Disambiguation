		<abstract>Adaptation in embedded processing is key in order to address effi- ciency. The concept of extensible embedded processors works well if a few a-priori known hot spots exist. However, they are far less efficient if many and possible at-design-time-unknown hot spots need to be dealt with. Our RISPP approach advances the extensible processor concept by providing flexibility through run- time</abstract>
