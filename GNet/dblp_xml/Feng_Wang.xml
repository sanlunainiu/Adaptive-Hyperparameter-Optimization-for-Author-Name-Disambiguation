		<abstract>This paper presents the design and implementation of a real-time behavior profiling system for high-speed Inter- net links. The profiling system uses flow-level information from continuous packet or flow monitoring systems, and uses data mining and information-theoretic techniques to automatically discover significant events based on the com- munication patterns of end-hosts. We demonstrate the oper- ational feasibility of the system</abstract>

		<abstract>Network lifetime is a critical issue in Wireless Sensor Networks. It is possible to extend network lifetime by organizing the sensors into a number of sensor covers. However, with the limited bandwidth, coverage breach (i.e, targets that are not covered) can occur if the number of available time-slots/channels is less than the number of sensors in a sensor cover.
