		<abstract>In this paper, we describe the unique security issues involved in healthcare domains. These have been addressed to the needs of the HealthAgents project. In the proposed approach, several levels of security have been provided in accordance with Software Engineering principles, ethical regulations for healthcare data, as well as the security requirements usually raised from the distributed clinical settings.

		<abstract>A distributed decision support system involving multiple clinical centres is crucial to the diagnosis of rare diseases. Although sharing of valid diagnosed cases can facilitate later decision making, possibly from geographically different centres, the released information could reveal patient privacy if it is not properly protected. Clinical centres may have to impose their distinct regulations and rules that govern the</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract The Adaptive Agent Model (AAM) achieves adaptivity in three areas. i) Agents are associated with business rules. These rules are configured by business analysts in a natural language style, using a Business Rules Editor, stored in an XML repository and executed by agents.  ii) The vocabularies of rules are easily changed. A Metadata Editor is described for this purpose,</abstract>

		<abstract>Multi-agent systems have become increasingly mature, but their appearance does not make the traditional OO approach obsolete. On the contrary, OO methodologies can benefit from the principles and tools designed for agent systems. The Agent/Rule/Class (ARC) framework is proposed as an approach that builds agents upon traditional OO system components and makes use of business rules to dictate agent behaviour</abstract>

		<abstract>Software systems used in a business environment must consider knowledge about business processes, business rules, business terms, and their manageability, adaptability, and maintainability due to changing environment over time. In this paper, from a Software Engineering perspective, we propose hierarchical structure for business knowledge that is then made available to agents running in systems. Such knowledge is sourced from the</abstract>

		<abstract>A method must be provided to support the analysis of security policy rules interdependencies in a (possibly distributed) environment. We propose a Conceptual Graphs based language that will allow us to represent the structure of information and to employ reasoning for consistency checking. We motivate our choice of language by the gained expressivity, the potential for depicting policy associations rigourously</abstract>

		<abstract>Realising the vision of pervasive healthcare will generate new challenges to system security. Such challenges are fundamentally different from issues and problems that we face in centralised approaches as well as non- clinical scenarios. In this paper, we reflect upon our experiences in the HealthAgents project wherein a prototype system was developed and a novel approach employed that supports data</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) supports,the transformation,from,reusable models to executable software. Business representations, however, cannot be fully and,explicitly represented,in such,models,for direct transformation,into running systems. Thus, once business needs change, the language abstractions used by MDA (e.g. object constraint language/action semantics), being low level, have to be edited directly. We therefore describe an agent-oriented MDA (AMDA) that uses a set of business,models,under,continuous,maintenance,by</abstract>

		<abstract>Model-driven architecture (MDA) supports model-centred software development via successive model transformation. In MDA, the reusability of models is improved as well as the traceability of requirements. Agent-oriented model-driven architecture (AMDA) associates adaptive agents with a business-oriented interaction model and lets agents dynamically interpret their behaviour from the continuously main- tained model via which the current business needs are deployed at</abstract>

		<abstract>Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) promotes the development of software systems through successive building and generation of mod- els, improving the reusability of models. Applying the same principles to the area of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) advances the ideas behind MDA even more significantly, due to the inherent adaptivity of software agents We describe an appropriate set of models originating from requirements</abstract>

On the contrary, building MAS in combination with OO constructs allows the reuse of existing components.
