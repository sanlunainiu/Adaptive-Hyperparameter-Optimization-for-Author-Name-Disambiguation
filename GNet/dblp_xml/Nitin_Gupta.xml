Querying such pathways is a challenging computational problem, and recent efforts have been limited to simple queries (paths), or simple networks (forests). In this paper, we significantly extend the class of pathways that can be efficiently queried to the case of trees, and graphs of bounded</abstract>

		<abstract>Recent work has shown that we can dramatically improve the performance of computer games and simulations through declarative processing: Character AI can be written in an imperative scripting language which is then compiled to re- lational algebra and executed by a special games engine with features similar to a main memory database system. In this paper we lay out a</abstract>

		<abstract>Networked virtual environments (net-VEs) are the next wave of digital entertainment, with Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOs) a very popular instance. Current MMO architectures are server-centric in that all game logic is e xecuted at the servers of the company hosting the game. This architecture has lead to severe scalability problems, in particular since MMOs require realistic graphics and game</abstract>

		<abstract>ABSTRACT We propose to demonstrate SGL, a language and system for writing computer,games,using data management,tech- niques. We will demonstrate a complete game,built using the system, and show how complex game behavior can be expressed in a declarative scripting language. The demo will also illustrate the workflow necessary to modify a game and include a visualization of the relational operations that</abstract>

		<abstract>We propose to demonstrate SEMMO, a consistency server for MMOs. The key features of SEMMO are its novel dis- tributed consistency protocol and system architecture. The distributed nature of the engine allows the clients to perform all computations locally; the only computation that the cen- tral server performs is to determine the serialization order of game actions. We will demo</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we outline several ways in which the database community can contribute to the development of technology for computer games. We outline the architecture of different types of computer games, and show how database technol- ogy plays a role in their design. From this, we identify sev- eral new research directions to improve the utilization of this technology</abstract>
