		<abstract>Several applications require the joint display of two phylogenetic trees whose leaves are matched by inter-tree edges. This issue arises, for example, when comparing gene trees and species trees or when studying the co-speciation of hosts and parasites. The tanglegram layout problem seeks to produce a layout of the two trees that minimizes the number of crossings between the inter-tree</abstract>

		<abstract>We consider the problem of reconciling gene trees with a species tree based on the widely accepted Gene Duplication model from Goodman et al. Current algorithms that solve this problem handle only binary gene trees or interpret polytomies in the gene tree as true. While in practice polytomies occur frequently, they are typically not true. Most polytomies represent unresolved evolutionary</abstract>
