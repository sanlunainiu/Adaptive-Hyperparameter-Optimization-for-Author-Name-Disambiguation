		<abstract>Excel spreadsheets were developed to teach the underlying math in a computer graphics course including reviewing basic linear algebra operations, tracing a series of OpenGL transformations, and creating Bezier curves and surfaces with forward differences. Each spreadsheet contains an English overview of the mathematical process and the numerical result of each sub step thus providing a high level of abstraction.</abstract>

		<abstract>Java has become the programming language of choice for the first computer programming course in most of the computer science programs in the country. However, Java is a true objected-oriented language and requires instructors to introduce object-oriented constructs (classes, objects and methods) early in the course. This poses a problem for both students (who find the introduction to objects to</abstract>

		<abstract>The authors have developed two hybrid internet courses with one weekly meeting per week instead of the traditional two or three meetings. One course teaches how to use Microsoft Office and is a service course. The other teaches Computer Graphics to computer science majors. The internet materials are structured to use each of the three student learning styles: visual, auditory,</abstract>

		<abstract>The authors' Compiler Design course at Bridgewater State College implemented a translator for a small language using Java. The project was broken into five assignments that included a language definition, extension of this language, a lexical analyzer, a recursive descent parser, and finally a code generator that generated Jasmin assembly language code for the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).</abstract>

		<abstract>A paperless computer applications course, which is driven by an online syllabus is described. Students demo their work on the computer rather than hand in paper assignments. Several advanced topics are included to challenge the students and downloads are provided to minimize the amount of student busywork. The use of weekly lecture and assignment downloads allow instructors to teach sections</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper proposes an optimization technique of genetic al- gorithm (GA) combined with Gaussian mixtures (GAGM) to make a robust, efficient and real time face alignment applica- tion for embedded systems. It uses 2.5D Active Appearance Model (AAM) for the face search, the model is generated by taking 3D landmarks and 2D texture of the face image. 3D face alignment</abstract>

		<abstract>The active appearance models (AAM) are robust in face alignment. We use this method to analyze gesture and motions of faces in Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for embedded systems (mobile phone, game con- sole, PDA: Personal Digital Assistant). However these models are not only high memory consumer but also efficient especially when the aligning objects in the learni ng data</abstract>
