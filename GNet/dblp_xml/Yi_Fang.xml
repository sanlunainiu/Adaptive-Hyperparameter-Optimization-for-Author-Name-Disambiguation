		<abstract>Prediction of motor shaft misalignment is essential for the development of effective coupling and rotating equipment maintenance information systems. It can be stated as a multivariate regression problem with ill-posed data. In this paper, hybrid models of principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLS) have been proposed for this problem. The basic idea of hybrid models is</abstract>
