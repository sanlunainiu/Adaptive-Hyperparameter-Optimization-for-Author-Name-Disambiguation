		<abstract>Data integration is needed in order to cope with the huge amounts of biological information now available and to perform data mining effectively. Current data integration systems have strict limitations, mainly due to the number of resources, their size and frequency of updates, their heterogeneity and distribution on the Internet. Integration must therefore be achieved by accessing network services through</abstract>

		<abstract>BACKGROUND: Complex microarray gene expression datasets can be used for many independent analyses and are particularly interesting for the validation of potential biomarkers and multi-gene classifiers. This article presents a novel method to perform correlations between microarray gene expression data and clinico-pathological data through a combination of available and newly developed processing tools. RESULTS: We developed Survival Online (available at</abstract>

		<abstract>Background: The huge amount of biological information, its distribution over the Internet and the heterogeneity of available software tools makes the adoption of new data integration and analysis network tools a necessity in bioinformatics. ICT standards and tools, like Web Services and Workflow Management Systems (WMS), can support the creation and deployment of such systems. Many Web Services are already</abstract>

		<abstract>BACKGROUND: Web Services and Workflow Management Systems can support creation and deployment of network systems, able to automate data analysis and retrieval processes in biomedical research. Web Services have been implemented at bioinformatics centres and workflow systems have been proposed for biological data analysis. New databanks are often developed by taking into account these technologies, but many existing databases do</abstract>

		<abstract>BACKGORUND: The completion of the Human Genome Project has resulted in large quantities of biological data which are proving difficult to manage and integrate effectively. There is a need for a system that is able to automate accesses to remote sites and to &quot;understand&quot; the information that it is managing in order to link data properly.

		<abstract>The Cell Line Data Base (CLDB) is a well-known reference information source on human and animal cell lines including information on more than 6000 cell lines. Main biological features are coded according to controlled vocabularies derived from international lists and taxonomies. HyperCLDB (http://bioinformatics.istge.it/hypercldb/) is a hyper- text version of CLDB that improves data accessibil- ity by also allowing information retrieval</abstract>
