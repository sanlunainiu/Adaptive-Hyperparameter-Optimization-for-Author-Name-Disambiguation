		<abstract>This paper addresses the problem of evaluating the quality of handwritten signatures used for biometric authentication. It is shown that some signature samples yield significantly worse performance than other samples from the same person. Thus, the importance of good ref- erence samples is emphasized. We also give some examples of features that are related to the signature stability and show</abstract>
