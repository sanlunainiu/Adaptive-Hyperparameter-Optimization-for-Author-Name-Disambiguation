		<abstract>With the development of positioning technologies and the boosting deployment of inexpensive location-aware sensors, large volumes of trajectory data have emerged. However, efficient and scalable query processing over trajectory data remains a big challenge. We explore a new approach to this target in this paper, presenting a new framework for query processing over trajectory data based on MapReduce. Traditional trajectory</abstract>

		<abstract>Indoor spaces accommodate large populations of individuals. The continuous range monitoring of such objects can be used as a foun- dation for a wide variety of applications, e.g., space planning, way finding, and security. Indoor space differs from outdoor space in that symbolic locations, e.g., rooms, rather than Euclidean posi- tions or spatial network locations are important. In addition, posi-</abstract>

		<abstract>The availability of indoor positioning renders it possible to deploy location-based services in indoor spaces. Many such services will benefit from the efficient support for k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries over large populations of indoor moving objects. However, existing kNN techniques fall short in indoor spaces because these differ from Euclidean and spatial network spaces and because of the limited</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract The tracking of the locations of moving objects in large indoor spaces is important, as it enables a range of appli- cations related to, e.g., security and indoor navigation and guidance. This paper presents a graph model based ap- proach to indoor tracking that offers a uniform data man- agement,infrastructure for different symbolic positioning technologies, e.g., Bluetooth and RFID.</abstract>

		<abstract>Indoor spaces accommodate large populations of individuals. With appropriate indoor positioning, e.g., Bluetooth and RFID, in place, large amounts of trajectory data result that may serve as a foundation for a wide variety of appli- cations, e.g., space planning, way finding, and security. This scenario calls for the indexing of indoor trajectories. Based on an appropriate notion of indoor trajec-</abstract>
