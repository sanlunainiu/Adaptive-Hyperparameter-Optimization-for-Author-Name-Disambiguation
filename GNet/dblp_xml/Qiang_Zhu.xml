		<abstract>Rock art, human-made markings on stone, is an important cultural artifact and the earliest expression of abstract thinking. While there are tens of millions of photographs of rock art in existence, there have been no large-scale attempts to organize, classify or cluster them. This omission is not due to a lack of interest, but reflects the extraordinary difficultly of extracting</abstract>

		<abstract>Rock art is an archaeological term for human-made markings on stone. It is believed that there are millions of petroglyphs in North America alone, and the study of this valued cultural resource has implications even beyond anthropology and history. Surprisingly, although image processing, information retrieval and data mining have had large impacts on many human endeavors, they have had essentially</abstract>

		<abstract>Time series motifs are pairs of individual time series, or subsequences of a longer time series, which are very similar to each other. As with their discrete analogues in computational biology, this similarity hints at structure which has been conserved for some reason and may therefore be of interest. Since the formalism of time series motifs in 2002, dozens of</abstract>

		<abstract>The star graph Sn is one of the most famous interconnection networks. It has been shown by Li (T.-K. Li, Cycle embed- ding in star graphs with edge faults, Appl. Math. Comput. 167 (2005) 891-900) that Sn contains a cycle of length from 6 to n! when the number of fault edges in the graph does not exceed n� 3.</abstract>

		<abstract>Fault tolerant measures have played an important role in the reliability of an inter- connection network. Edge connectivity, restricted-edge-connectivity, extra-edge-connec- tivity and super-edge-connectivity of many well-known interconnection networks have been explored. In this paper, we study the 2-extra-edge connectivity of a special class of graphs G(G0, G1; M) proposed by Chen et al. (Appl. Math. Comput. 140 (2003) 245- 254).</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we explore the 2-extra connectivity and 2-extra-edge-connectivity of the folded hypercube FQn. We show that j2(FQn )=3 n � 2 for n P 8; and k2(FQn )=3 n � 1 for n P 5. That is, for n P 8 (resp. n P 5), at least 3n � 2 vertices (resp. 3n � 1 edges) of FQn</abstract>
