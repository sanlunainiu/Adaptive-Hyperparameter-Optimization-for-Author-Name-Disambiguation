		<abstract>Abstractâ€”Data aggregation is an essential operation in wireless sensor network applications. This paper focuses on the data aggregation scheduling problem. Based on maximal independent sets, a distributed algorithm to generate a collision-free schedule for data aggregation in wireless sensor networks is proposed. The time latency of the aggregation schedule generated by the proposed algorithm is minimized using a greedy strategy.</abstract>
