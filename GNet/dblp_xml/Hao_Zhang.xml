		<abstract>In this paper, we apply Nystrom method, a sub-sampling and reconstruction technique, to speed up spectral mesh processing. We flrst relate this method to Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). This enables us to derive a novel measure in the form of a matrix trace, based soly on sampled data, to quantify the quality of Nystrom approx- imation. The measure is</abstract>

		<abstract>Face recognition is one of the most intensively studied topics in computer vision and pattern recognition. Facial expression, which changes face geometry, usually has an adverse effect on the performance of a face recognition sys- tem. On the other hand, face geometry is a useful cue for recognition. Taking these into account, we utilize the idea of separating geometry and</abstract>
