		<abstract>Motivation: Methylation of cytosines in DNA plays an import- ant role in the regulation of gene expression, and the analysis of methylation patterns is fundamental for the understanding of cell differentiation, aging processes, diseases and cancer development. Such analysis has been limited, because tech- nologies for detailed and efficient high-throughput studies have not been available. We have developed a novel</abstract>
