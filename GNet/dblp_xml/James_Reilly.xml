		<abstract>End-to-end routing in connection-oriented broadband networks, which satisfies end-user quality of service (QoS) constraints, is an extremely complex problem. The complexity of the problem is compounded in multi- domain, multi-provider networks for a number of reasons. For example, operators of some public networks may not wish to fully disclose their internal network topologies and a highly detailed picture of their</abstract>

		<abstract>Future broadband networks will provide end-to-end connections which span multiple networks, operators, domains and technologies. The abil- ity to supply end-to-end connections depends on the ability to satisfy (in near real-time) end-user topology, schedule (availability of resources in the present or future), quality of service and cost constraints. This paper examines the problems imposed by schedule constraints, as they allow</abstract>

		<abstract>Network and system maintenance personnel are increasingly mobile. This creates a potential market for a network, system and service management terminal that is highly mobile, which would supplement existing network and system management solutions. This paper presents a generic architectural solution for this problem based on a highly scalable and network-centric approach to development of network management applications. Although the</abstract>
