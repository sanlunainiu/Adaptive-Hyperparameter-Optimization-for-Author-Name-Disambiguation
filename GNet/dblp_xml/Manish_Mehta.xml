		<abstract>Classification is an important problem in the emerging field of data mining. Although classification has been studied extensively in the past, most of the classification algorithms are designed only for memory-resident data, thus limiting their suitability for data mining large data sets. This paper discusses issues in building a scalable classi- fier and presents the design of SLIQ' , a</abstract>

An example of an association rule is: \30% of transactions that contain beer also contain diapers; 2% of all transactions contain both of these items&quot;. Here 30% is called the condence of the rule, and 2% the support</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper explores the application of the Min- imum Description Length principle for pruning decision trees. We present a new algorithm that intuitively captures the primary goal of reduc- ing the misclassification error. An experimental comparison is presented with three other prun- ing algorithms. The results show that the MDL pruning algorithm achieves good accuracy, small trees, and fast execution</abstract>

		<abstract>Data placement in shared-nothing database systems has been studied extensively in the past and various placement algorithms have been proposed. However, there is no consensus on the most efficient data placement algorithm and placement is still performed manually by a database administrator with periodic reorganization to correct mistakes. This paper presents the first comprehensive simulation study of data placement issues</abstract>

		<abstract>Eficient schemes for key predistribution and shared-key discovery play a vital role in security and eficiency of pairwise key establishment an sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a scheme for key predistribution using hash-chain and subsequent shared-key discove y. We show potential active attacks on sensor networks due to key predistribution which can have severer consequences as compared to</abstract>

		<abstract>Sensor networks are composed of a large number of low power sensor devices. For secure communication among sensors, secret keys must be established between them. Recently, several pairwise key schemes have been proposed for large distributed sensor networks. These schemes randomly select a set of keys from a key pool and install the keys in the memory of each sensor.</abstract>

		<abstract>Sensor networks are composed of a large number of low power sensor devices. For secure communication among sensors, secret keys are required to be established between them. Considering the storage limitations and the lack of post- deployment configuration information of sensors, Random Ke y Predistribution schemes have been proposed. Due to limited number of keys, sensors can only share keys</abstract>
