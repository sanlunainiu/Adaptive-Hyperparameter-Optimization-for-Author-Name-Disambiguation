		<abstract>Enterprise and data center networks consist of a large number of complex networked applications and services that depend upon each other. For this reason, they are difficult to manage and diagn ose. In this paper we propose Macroscope, a new approach to extracting the dependencies of networked applications automatically by com- bining application process information with network level packet traces.</abstract>

		<abstract>We propose a solution to improve fairness and in- crease throughput in wireless networks with location informa- tion. Our approach consists of a multipath routing protocol, Bi- ased Geographical Routing (BGR), and two congestion control algorithms, In-Network Packet Scatter (IPS) and End-to-End Packet Scatter (EPS), which leverage BGR to avoid the con- gested areas of the network. BGR achieves good</abstract>

		<abstract>The progress of mobile device technology unfolds a new spectrum of applications that challenges conventional infrastructure models. Most of these devices are perceived by their users as &quot;appliances&quot; rather than computers and accordingly the application management should be done transparently by the underlying system unlike classic applications managed explicitly by the user. Memory management on such devices should consider new</abstract>

		<abstract>We address the problem of balancing the traffic load in multi-hop wireless networks. We consider a point-to-point communicating network with a uniform distribution of source-sink pairs. When routing along shortest paths, the nodes that are centrally located forward a disproportionate amount of traffic. This translates into increased congestion and energy consumption. However, the maximum load can be decreased if the</abstract>

		<abstract>Sensor networks are notoriously difficult to program, given that they encompass the complexities of both dis- tributed and embedded systems. To address this problem, we present the design and implementation of a declarative sensor network platform, DSN: a declarative language, com- piler and runtime suitable for programming a broad range of sensornet applications. We demonstrate that our approach is a</abstract>

		<abstract>The database and sensor network community have both rec- ognized the utility of SQL for interfacing with sensor net- work systems. Recently there have been proposals to con- struct Internet protocols declaratively in variants of Datalog. We take these ideas to their logical extreme, and demon- strate entire distributed sensor network systems built declar- atively. Our demo exposes the rapidity,</abstract>
