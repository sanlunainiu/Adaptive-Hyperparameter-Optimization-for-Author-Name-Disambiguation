		<abstract>In this paper, a new hybrid of genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), referred to as GSA, is presented. In this algorithm, SA is incorporated into GA to escape from the local optima. Then, the idea of hierarchical parallel GA is borrowed to parallelize GSA for the optimization of multimodal functions. In addition, multi-niche crowding is used to maintain</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper presents a parallel genetic simulated annealing (PGSA) algorithm that has been developed and applied to optimize continuous problems. In PGSA, the entire population is divided into subpopulations, and in each subpopulation the algorithm uses the local search ability of simulated annealing after crossover and mutation. The best individuals of each subpopulation are migrated to neighboring ones after certain</abstract>

		<abstract>Scientific applications like neuroscience data analysis are usually compute and data-intensive. With the use of the additional capacity offered by distributed resources and suitable middlewares, we can achieve much shorter exe- cution time, distribute compute and storage load, and add greater flexibility to the execution of these scientific appli- cations than we could ever achieve in a single compute re-</abstract>

		<abstract>Workflow Management System is generally utilized to define, manage and execute workflow applications on Grid resources. However, the increasing scale complexity, heterogeneity and dynamism of Grid environment that includes networks, resources and applications have made such workflow management systems brittle, unmanageable and insecure. Auto- nomic computing provides a holistic approach for the design and development of systems/applications that can adapt</abstract>

		<abstract>In the current approaches to workflow scheduling, there is no cooperation between the distributed workflow brokers and as a result, the problem of conflicting schedules occur. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a decentralized and cooperative workflow scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach utilizes a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) coordination space with respect to coordinating the application schedules among the</abstract>

		<abstract>Effective scheduling is a key concern for the execution of performance driven Grid applications. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Critical Path (DCP) based workflow scheduling algorithm that determines effi- cient mapping of tasks by calculating the critical path in the workflow task graph at every step. It assigns priority to a task in the critical path which is</abstract>

This paper discusses a general purpo se archi- tecture which provides a framework for designing complex multi-user systems capable of interfacing with these services.
