		<abstract>A theoretical analysis for evaluating the performance of a lincoded continuous phase optical frequency shift keying (CPFSK) optical transmission system with delay line demodulation receiver is presented. It accounts for the combined effects of signal phase distortion due to polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and group velocity dispersion (GVD) in a single mode fiber. The analysis is carried out for three</abstract>

		<abstract>Addressing the problem of spam emails in the Internet, this paper presents a comparative study on Na\&quot;ive Bayes and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based modeling of spammer behavior. Keyword-based spam email filtering techniques fall short to model spammer behavior as the spammer constantly changes tactics to circumvent these filters. The evasive tactics that the spammer uses are themselves patterns that</abstract>

		<abstract>Irreversible logic circuits dissipate heat for every bit of information that is lost. Information is lost when the input vector cannot be recovered from its corresponding output vector. Reversible logic circuit naturally takes care of heating because it implements only the functions that have one-to-one mapping between its input and output vectors. Therefore reversible logic design becomes one of the</abstract>

		<abstract>Reversible circuits have applications in digital signal processing, computer graphics, quantum computation and cryptography. In this paper, a generalized k*k reversible gate family is proposed and a 3*3 gate of the family is discussed. Inverter, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and EXOR gates can be realized by this gate. Implementation of a full-adder circuit using two such 3*3 gates is given.</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we have introduced an algorithm to implement a sorting network for reversible logic synthesis based on swapping bit strings. The algorithm first constructs a network in terms of n*n Toffoli gates read from left to right. The number of gates in the circuit produced by our algorithm is then reduced by template matching and removing useless gates</abstract>

		<abstract>Spam is commonly known as unsolicited or unwanted email messages in the Internet causing potential threat to Internet Security. Users spend a valuable amount of time deleting spam emails. More importantly, ever increasing spam emails occupy server storage space and consume network bandwidth. Keyword-based spam email filtering strategies will eventually be less successful to model spammer behavior as the spammer</abstract>

		<abstract>In parity preserving reversible circuit, the parity of the input vector must match the parity of the output vector. It renders a wide class of circuit faults readily detectable at the circuit's outputs. Thus reversible logic circuits that are parity preserving will be beneficial to the development of fault tolerant systems in nanotechnology. This paper presents an efficient realization of</abstract>
