		<abstract>A range of adaptive orthogonal frequency division multiplex (AOFDM) video systems are proposed for interactive communications over wireless channels. The proposed constant target bit-rate subband adaptive OFDM modems can provide a lower bit error rate than a corresponding conventional OFDM modem. The slightly more complex switched or time-variant target bit rate AOFDM modems can provide a balanced video quality performance,</abstract>

		<abstract>Modern electrical locomotives are powered by controlled power converters. Integration testing of the vehicle control system is performed using real-time simulation. The present contribution presents an evaluation of a digital real-time simulator for this purpose, with particular emphasis on switching and events, which is one of the more demanding tasks in the real-time simulation of hybrid systems. A pragmatic solution</abstract>
