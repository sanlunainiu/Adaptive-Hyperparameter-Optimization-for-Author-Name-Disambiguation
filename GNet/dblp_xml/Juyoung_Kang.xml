		<abstract>Spatio-temporal frequent patterns discovered from historical trajectories of moving objects can provide important knowledge for location-based services. To address the problem of finding sequential patterns from spatio-temporal datasets, continuous values of spatial and temporal attributes should be discretized with the minimum loss of information. Since data carries spatio-temporal correlation among attributes, it should be preserved during discretization to derive accurate</abstract>
