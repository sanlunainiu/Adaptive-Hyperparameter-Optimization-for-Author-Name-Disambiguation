		<abstract>A uniform color space in terms of just-noticeable differ- ences (JND) to the human eye is important in industry and image processing, as well as for visually lossless image cod- ing and noise evaluations. The method of this paper builds a non-linear color space, by making use of structural anal- ysis with various JND data sets. Through computer simu- lation,</abstract>

		<abstract>A uniform chromaticity scale (UCS) in terms of just-noticeable difference (JND) to the human eye is important in industry and image processing, as well as for visually lossless image coding and noise evaluations. CIELUV, which aims at mi- croscopic uniformity to human perception, is widely used in color representation. However, its uniformity needs further improvements. In this paper, we demonstrate</abstract>

		<abstract>A new spatio-temporal pre-filter based on anisotropic diffusion is proposed. The filter has a nonlinear feature; it is capable of smoothing out white noise and insignificant textures in a video sequence in order to improve coding efficiency, while preserving such significant information as object edges. Computer simulation results verify that the subjective quality of a compressed video sequence is usually</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper focuses on the &quot;sprite coding&quot; that supports the MPEG-4 Version 1 Main profile in order to transfer &quot;near VHS quality video &quot; across narrow-band transmission links such as the Internet. Automatic VOP (Video Object Plane) generation technologies are being studied as one of the most important issues of MPEG-4 object coding. This paper proposes a two-layer VOP generation</abstract>
