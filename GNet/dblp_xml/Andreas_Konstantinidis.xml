		<abstract>In this paper, we propose a Subproblem-dependent Heuristic (SH) for MOEA/D to deal with the Deployment and Power Assignment Problem (DPAP) in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The goal of the DPAP is to assign locations and transmit power levels to sensor nodes for maximizing the network coverage and lifetime objectives. In our method, the DPAP is decomposed into a number</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstractâ€” Wireless Sensor Networks design requires high quality location assignment and energy efficient power assi gn- ment for maximizing the network coverage and lifetime. Classical deployment and power,assignment approaches optimize these two objectives individually or by combining them together in a single objective or by constraining one and optimizing the other.

		<abstract>Wireless Sensor Networks Deployment and Power Assignment Problems (DPAPs) for maximizing the network cov- erage and lifetime respectively, have received increasing attention recently. Classical approaches optimize these two objectives individually, or by combining them together in a single objective, or by constraining one and optimizing the other. In this paper, the two problems are formulated as a multi-objective DPAP and</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract Cost-effective topology,control is critical in wireless sensor networks. While much,research has been carried out in this aspect using various methods, no attention has been made on utilizing modern heuristics for this purpose. This paper proposes a memetic algorithm- based solution for energy-aware topology control for wireless sensor networks. This algorithm (called ToCMA), using a combination of problem-specific light-weighted local</abstract>
