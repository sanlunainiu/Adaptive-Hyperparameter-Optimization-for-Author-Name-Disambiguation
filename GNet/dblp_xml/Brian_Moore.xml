		<abstract>In this paper, we report on a recently funded project called Re- naissance Computing, an initiative for promoting student partici- pation in computing. We propose what we consider a radical re- thinking not only of our core curriculum in computer science, but of the role of computer science at the university level. In our conception, ―computational thinking‖ is neither easily</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, a new method to determine the complete set of dynam- ically balanced planar four-bar mechanims is presented. Using complex variables to model the kinematics of the mechanism, the dynamic balanc- ing constraints are written as algebraic equations over complex variables and joint angular velocities. After elimination of the joint angular ve- locity variables, the problem is formulated</abstract>

		<abstract>iWarp is a parallel architecture developed jointly by Carnegie Mellon University and Intel Corporation. The iWarp communication system supports two widely used interprocessor communication styles: memory communication and systolic communication. This paper describes the rationale, architecture, and implementation for the iWarp communication system.The sending or receiving processor of a message can perform either memory or systolic communication. In memory communication,</abstract>
