		<abstract>A digital game is normally controlled by hand. Playing such a game requires only minimum hand movements. Rather than being easy and comfortable, this game controller is de- signed to be physically taxing for the players.

		<abstract>Star-Kick is a commercially available and fully auto- matic table soccer (foosball) robot, which plays table soccer games against human players on a competitive level. One of our research goals is to learn this table soccer robot skillful actions similar to a human player based on a moderate number of trials. Two indepen- dent learning algorithms are employed for learning</abstract>
