		<abstract>We propose a method, which treats metal artifact reduction in CT by sinogram restoration as a problem of scattered data interpola- tion. Corrupted sinogram entries are discarded and replaced with artifi- cially generated values. The presented interpolation algorithm is based on the 2D non-equispaced fast Fourier transform (NFFT). Results are compared to two common polynomial interpolation schemes.</abstract>

		<abstract>We present a method to improve the quality of common sino- gram restoration algorithms, which are used for metal-artifact reduction in X-ray CT. The presented approach is based on the idea that the in- tersection length of all beams through the object of interest can approx- imately be calculated from a preliminary reconstruction of the object.
