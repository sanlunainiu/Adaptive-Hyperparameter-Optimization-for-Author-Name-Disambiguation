		<abstract>For students in computer science, knowledge of programming domain needs to be organized and shared efficiently. In this paper, we propose a method to present programming domain knowledge with ontology. We develop the programming knowledge domain ontology analogous to a dictionary. Therefore, the programming domain knowledge becomes machine-understandable and thus can be shared and reused among different implementations.</abstract>
