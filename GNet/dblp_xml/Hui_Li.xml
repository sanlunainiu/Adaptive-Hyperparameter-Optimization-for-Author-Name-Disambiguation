		<abstract>An increasing range of problems in Artificial Intelli- gence and Computer Science, such as autonomous vehi- cle control and planning with resources, are formulated through a combination of logical, algebraic and cost constraints. Their solution requires a hybrid mixture of logical decision techniques and mathematical opti- mization. Using Disjunctive Linear Programs (DLPs) to formulate these problems, we present a novel</abstract>
