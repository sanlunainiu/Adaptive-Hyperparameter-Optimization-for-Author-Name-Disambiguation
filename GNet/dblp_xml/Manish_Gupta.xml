		<abstract>Email spam is a much studied topic, but even though current email spam detecting software has been gaining a competitive edge against text based email spam, new advances in spam generation have posed a new challenge: image-based spam. Image based spam is email which includes embedded images containing the spam messages, but in binary format. In this paper, we study</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract One of the fastest growing applications in the banking arena is Electronic Bill Presentation and Payment (EBPP), driven primarily by a desire to reduce costs associated with issuing and settling physical bills. EBPP is a secure system for companies to electronically present bills and other related information to their customers, and host the secure payment of these bills. This</abstract>

		<abstract>Enterprise middleware systems typically consist of a large cluster of machines with stringent performance requirements. Hence, when a performance problem occurs in such environments, it is critical that the health monitoring software identifies the root cause of the problem with minimal delay. A technique commonly used for isolating performance problem root causes is rule definition, which involves specifying combinations or</abstract>

		<abstract>Multi-tiered enterprise applications, which comprise of many (heterogeneous and possibly loosely coupled) components at various layers of the IT stack, typically have configuration dependencies between these different components. A change in the value of a configuration parameter of a component may require changing one or more parameters of other components to the same value. Keeping track of these dependencies is</abstract>

		<abstract>Clustered enterprise middleware systems employing dynamic workload scheduling are susceptible to a variety of application malfunctions that can manifest themselves in a counterintuitive fashion and cause debilitating damage. Until now, diagnosing problems in that domain involves investigating log files and configuration settings and requires in-depth knowledge of the middleware architecture and application design.

		<abstract>In this paper we consider the distributed simulation of queueing networks of FCFS servers with infinite buffers, and irreducible Markovian routing. We first show that for either the conservative or optimistic syn- chronization protocols the simulation of such networks can prematurely block owing to event buffer exhaus- tion. Buffer exhaustion can occur in the simulator whether or not the simulator</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper we study message flow processes in distributed simulators of open queueing networks.

We characterize the &quot;external'' arrival process, and the message feedback process in the simulator of a simple queueing network with feedback. We show that a certain &quot;natural'' modelling construct for the arrival</abstract>
