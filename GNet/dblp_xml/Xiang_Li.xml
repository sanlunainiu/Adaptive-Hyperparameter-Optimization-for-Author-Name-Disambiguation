		<abstract>Schema merging is the process of integrating several schemas into a common, unified schema. There have been various approaches to schema merg- ing, focusing on particular modeling languages, or using a lightweight, abstract metamodel. Having a semantically rich representation of models and mappings is particularly important for merging as semantic information is required to resolve the conflicts encountered. Therefore, our</abstract>

		<abstract>Health and mobility of elderly people is gaining im- portance in aging societies. New communication-based methods to provide health services with personal health care devices are considered promising elements of first-class medical care services for everybody. To achieve this vision, several technological issues have to be solved: (i) body sensors to monitor vital functions have to be developed; (ii) these</abstract>

		<abstract>Schema matching is the task of automatically computing correspon- dences between schema elements. A multitude of schema matching approaches exists for various scenarios using syntactic, semantic, or instance information. The schema matching problem is aggravated by the fact that models to be matched are often represented in different modeling languages, e.g. OWL, XML Schema, or SQL DDL. Consequently, besides being</abstract>

		<abstract>GeRoMeSuite is a generic model management system which provides several functions for managing complex data models, such as schema integration, definition and execution of schema mappings, model transformation, and match- ing. The system uses the generic metamodel GeRoMe for representing models, and because of this, it is able to deal with models in various modeling languages such as XML Schema,</abstract>

		<abstract>Manipulation of models and mappings is a common task in the de- sign and development of information systems. Research in Model Management aims at supporting these tasks by providing a set of operators to manipulate models and mappings. As a framework, GeRoMeSuite provides an environment to simplify the implemen- tation of model management operators. GeRoMeSuite is based on the generic</abstract>

		<abstract>In this article we present extensional mappings, that are based on second order tuple gener- ating dependencies between models in our Generic Role-based Metamodel GeRoMe. Our mappings support data translation between heterogeneous models, such as XML Schemas, relational schemas, or OWL ontologies. The mapping language provides grouping func- tionalities that allow for complete restructuring of data, which is necessary for</abstract>
