		<abstract>This paper proposes a search tree pruning strategy for SAT solving. It is called Local Lemma, because it generates lemmas from explored subtrees and these lemmas are valid only in a part of the search tree. The paper explains the basic principle of the strategy, illustrates it with an example, and presents some experimental results.</abstract>

		<abstract>Finding models of first-order formulas is an important and challenging problem in computational logic. Many satisfiable formulas have finite models. To find a finite model of a first- order formula, one may use a backtracking search procedure directly, or transform the problem into propositional satisfiability. In the former approach, symmetries can be used effectively to prune the search space; while</abstract>

An essential algorithm for solving the problem is backtracking search. In this paper, we show how to improve such a search procedure by lemma learning. For eciency reasons, we represent the lemmas by propositional formulas and use a SAT solver to perform</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract—Application,classification techniques,based on mon- itoring and learning of resource usage (e.g. CPU, memory, disk and,network) have been proposed,to aid in resource,scheduling decisions. An,important,problem,that,arises in application classifiers is how,to decide which subset of numerous,performance metrics collected from,monitoring,tools should,be used for the classification. This paper presents an approach,based on a prob- abilistic model,(Bayesian Network) to systematically,select the representative performance features, which can</abstract>

		<abstract>Application awareness is an important factor of efficient resource scheduling. This paper introduces a novel ap- proach for application classification based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the k-Nearest Neighbor (k- NN) classifier.

		<abstract>Abstract—Visualizing the intellectual structure of scientific domains,using co-cited units such,as references,or authors has become aroutine for  domain  analysis.  In  previous  studies,  paper-reference  matrices  are  usually  transformed  into  reference-reference  matrices to obtain co-citation relationships, which are then visualized in different representations,typically as node-link networks, to represent the intellectual structures of scientific domains. Such network visualizations sometimes contain tightly knit components, which</abstract>

However, it is difficult to optimize both concurrently. Moreover, most conventional image registration approaches are unsuccessful in registering images requiring large transformations due to the computational constraints.
