		<abstract>A printed ultra wideband (UWB) antenna suitable for multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB- OFDM) UWB is presented in this paper. The proposed antenna covers a wide band from 3.1 GHz to 11.2 GHz. Good performance and low cost production was obtained using FR-4 substrate. An examination of the effects of ground plane dimensions on antenna properties such as gain,</abstract>
