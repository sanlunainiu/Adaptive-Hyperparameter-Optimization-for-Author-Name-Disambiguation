		<abstract>Scanline is currently developing the proprietary crowd-simulation tool &quot;Sheep&quot;. It is designed to generate mass scenes with 15.000 different characters, animate them by an unlimited amount of rules, supply presimulated cloth and render a whole shot in a single layer taking less than 45 minutes. This will disclose completely new dimensions for the realization of Visual Effects with mass sequences.</abstract>
