		<abstract>Software development is getting more and more complex, espe- cially within distributed middleware-based environments. A major drawback during the overall software development process is the lack of on-line tools, i.e. tools applied as soon as there is a running proto- type of an application. The MIMO MIddleware MOnitor provides a solution to this problem by implementing a framework for an</abstract>

		<abstract>We describe the methodology used for the design of the CMOS processor chipset used in the IBM S/390 Parallel Enterprise Server - Generation 3. The majority of the logic is implemented by standard cell elements placed and routed flat, using timing-driven techniques. The result is a globally optimized solution without artificial floorplan boundaries. We will show that the density in</abstract>
