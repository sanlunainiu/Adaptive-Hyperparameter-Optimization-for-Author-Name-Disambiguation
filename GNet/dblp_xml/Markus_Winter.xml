		<abstract>Ã³Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoC) with Network-on-Chip based interconnection systems have emerged as the promising solution to computation intensive signal processing applications. But the mapping of applications onto the MPSoC and the allocation of computation and communication resources for applications, jobs and tasks is still a challenge. In this paper we describe the concept of a global communication resource allocator working on</abstract>
