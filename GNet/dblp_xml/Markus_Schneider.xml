		<abstract>Certificate-based authentication of parties provides a power- ful means for verifying claimed identities, since communicating partners do not have to exchange secrets in advance for authentication. This is es- pecially valuable for roaming scenarios in mobile communications. When dealing with certificates, one must cope with the verification of complete certificate paths for security reasons. In mobile communications, there exist special</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract. Web technologies provide several means to infringe user privacy. This is especially true when,customers with the intent to buy tangible goods submit their orders containing their real identity and physical address. Then in practice, the vendor can link this information with all information gathered about the customer beforehand, e.g., observation data on him while browsing through the product catalog.</abstract>

		<abstract>Loyalty systems provide an interesting possibility for vendors in customer relationship management. This holds for both real world and online vendors. Beside potential benefits of loyalty systems, customers may fear an invasion of privacy, and thus often refuse to participate in such pro- grams. In this paper, we present two variants of a privacy- friendly loyalty system to be used</abstract>

		<abstract>A coupon represents the right to claim some service which is typically offered by vendors. In practice, issuing bundled multi-coupons is more efcient than issuing single coupons separately. The diversity of interests of the parties involved in a coupon system demands additional security properties beyond the common requirements (e.g., unforgeability). Customers wish to preserve their privacy when using the multi-coupon</abstract>
