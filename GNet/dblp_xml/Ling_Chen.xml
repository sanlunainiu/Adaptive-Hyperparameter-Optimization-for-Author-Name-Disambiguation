		<abstract>Recently, several approaches that mine frequent XML query patterns and cache their results have been proposed to improve query response time. However, frequent XML query patterns mined by these approaches ignore the temporal sequence between user queries. In this paper, we take into account the temporal features of user queries to dis- cover association rules, which indicate that when a</abstract>

The change of the data values or struc- tures of an XML document may exhibit some particular patterns. In this paper, we focus on the sequence of changes to the structures of an XML document to flnd out which subtrees in the XML structure frequently</abstract>

		<abstract>Video classification is an important step towards multimedia understanding. Most state-of-the-art approaches which apply HMM to capture the temporal information of videos have the limitation by assuming that the current state of a video depends only on the immediate previous state. Nevertheless, this assumption may not hold for videos of various categories. In this paper, we present an effective video</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper presents a novel pattern called temporal indirect associ- ation. An indirect association pattern refers to a pair of items that rarely occur together but highly depend on the presence of a mediator itemset. The exist- ing model of indirect association does not consider the lifespan of items. Con- sequently, some discovered patterns may be invalid while some useful</abstract>

For example, companies and organizations can efficiently get feedback from consumers observing their online interaction with social media providers. Offering accurately personalized services is possible now, since users provide more personal information about themselves openly, which was previously much more</abstract>

		<abstract>As a fundamental and critical component of music infor- mation retrieval (MIR) systems, music genre classiflcation has attracted considerable research attention. Automati- cally classifying music by genre is, however, a challenging problem due to the fact that music is an evolving art. While most of the existing work categorizes music using features extracted from music audio signals, in this paper,</abstract>

		<abstract>Mirroring Web sites is a well-known technique commonly used in the Web community. A mirror site should be up- dated frequently to ensure that it reflects the content of the original site. Existing mirroring tools apply page-level strategies to check each page of a site, which is inefficient and expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel site-level mirror maintenance</abstract>

In this paper, we focus on detecting events from Web click-through data generated by Web search engines. We propose a novel approach which effectively detects events from click-through data based on robust</abstract>
