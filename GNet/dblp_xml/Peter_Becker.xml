		<abstract>Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) has typically been applied in the field of software engineering to support software maintenance and object-oriented class identification tasks. This paper presents a broader overview by describing and classifying academic papers that report the application of FCA to software engineering. The papers are classified using a framework based on the activities defined in the ISO12207 Software</abstract>

		<abstract>Information technology of today is often concerned with information that is not only large in quantity but also complex in structure. Understanding this structure is important in many domains - many quantitative approaches such as data mining have been proposed to address this issue. This paper presents a conceptual approach based on Formal Concept Analysis. Using software source code as</abstract>
