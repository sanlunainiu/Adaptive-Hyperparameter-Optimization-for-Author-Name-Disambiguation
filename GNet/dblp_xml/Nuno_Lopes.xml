		<abstract>The system presented in this paper aims at using Contex- tual Logic Programming as a computational hub for knowledge modeled by web ontologies and enable querying that representation. The compo- nents required to behave as a SPARQL query engine are explained and examples of semantic integration of dierent sources are shown.</abstract>

		<abstract>We describe a system in which Contextual Logic Program- ming is used as a mediator for knowledge modeled by ontologies. Our system provides the components required to behave as a SPARQL query engine and, as a result of its Logic Programming heritage, it may also recursively interrogate other ontologies or data repositories, providing a semantic integration of multiple sources.</abstract>
