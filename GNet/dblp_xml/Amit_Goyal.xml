		<abstract>We introduce a novel frequent pattern mining approach to discover leaders and tribes in social networks. In particular, we consider social networks where users perform actions. Actions may be as simple as tagging resources (urls) as in del.icio.us, rating songs as in Yahoo! Music, or movies as in Yahoo! Movies, or users buying gadgets such as cameras, handhelds, etc. and</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstractâ€” In this demo we introduce GuruMine, a pattern mining system for the discovery of leaders, i.e., influential users in social networks, and their tribes, i.e., a set of users usually influenced by the same leader over several actions. GuruMine,is built upon a novel pattern mining framework for leaders discovery, that we introduced in [1]. In particular, we consider social</abstract>

		<abstract>Recently, there has been tremendous interest in the phe- nomenon of influence propagation in social networks. The studies in this area assume they have as input to their prob- lems a social graph with edges labeled with probabilities of influence between users. However, the question of where these probabilities come from or how they can be computed from real social</abstract>

		<abstract>In the context of influence propagation in a social graph, we can identify three orthogonal dimensions - the number of seed nodes activated at the beginning (known as budget), the expected number of activated nodes at the end of the propagation (known as expected spread or coverage), and the time taken for the propagation. We can constrain one or two</abstract>
