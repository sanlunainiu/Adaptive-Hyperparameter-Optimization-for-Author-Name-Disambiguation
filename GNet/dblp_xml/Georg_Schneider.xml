		<abstract>In this paper we present the system AWI (A Workbench for semi-automated Illustration design). AWI provides operationalizations of illustration techniques frequently used in technical illustration. Given that pure editing systems are too low-level, and that automatically generated illustrations are often suboptimal with regard to functional and aesthetic aspects, semi-automatism seems a reasonable way to produce effective illustrations more efficiently.

		<abstract>Two different areas of distributed group work are supported by workflow management systems and real-time collaboration systems. Workflow management systems sup- port work being structured in steps such that each step can be handled with the results of former steps and the expertise of the person working on that step. On the other hand, multimedia collaboration systems are best suited</abstract>

		<abstract>A maintenance engineer who talks to pumps and pipes may not seem like the ideal person to entrust with keeping a factory running smoothly, but we hope that our Mobile Reality framework will enable such behavior in the future to be anything but suspicious! Described in this paper is how the Mobile Reality framework, running entirely on a Pocket PC,</abstract>

		<abstract>In recent years, small screen devices, such as cellular phones or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), enjoy phenomenal popularity. PDAs can be used to complement traditional computing systems to access personal multimedia information beyond the usage as digital organizers. However, due to the physical limitations accessing rich multimedia contents and diverse services using a single PDA is more difficult. Hence, the</abstract>

		<abstract>Contemporary small screen devices are used as personal companion or communication devices. However, their physical dimensions constrain the processing, communication and user interface capabilities. Thus, rich content presentation and diverse service access via small screen appliances is limited accordingly. This paper introduces the Composite Device Computing Environment (CDCE) that provides a framework for dynamically detecting and utilising surrounding computing resources</abstract>
