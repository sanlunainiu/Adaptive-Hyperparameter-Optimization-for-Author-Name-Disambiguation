		<abstract>In recent years, the famous wiretap channel has been revisited by many researchers and information theoretic secrecy has become an active area of research in this setting. In this paper, we design a wireless communication system that achieves constant bit rate data transmission over a block fading channel, securely from an eavesdropper that listens to the transmitter over another independent</abstract>
