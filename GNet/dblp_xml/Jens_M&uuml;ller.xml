		<abstract>Business information systems provide computer support for decision making across huge data sets. Smart Items are miniaturized computer and sensing systems embedded into physical goods, items and assets. This paper proposes col- laborative Smart Items for pushing business relevant computing as close as possi- ble into the real world. Collaboration is enabled through an auction-based negotia- tion mechanism running distributed</abstract>

		<abstract>Smart items are physical objects that are enhanced by information technology. There are a number of different smart item technologies available, all of which have different capabilities, protocols, and management functionality. These devices have become an attractive solution for enterprise scenarios. In such scenarios lifecycle management can become a challenge when considering the differences of the smart item types while</abstract>

		<abstract>While massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) involve large numbers of simultaneous players, two other popular game classes -- first-person shooter (FPS) and real-time strategy (RTS) games - are still only rarely considered for massively multiplayer gaming. A main technical problem for scaling these genres to be massively multiplayer is the absence of a suitable scalable multiserver networking approach. While</abstract>

		<abstract>Computer games played over the Internet have recently be- come an important class of distributed applications. In this paper we present a novel proxy server-network topology aiming at improved scala- bility of multiplayer games and low latency in client-server data transmis- sion. We present a mechanism to ecien tly synchronize the distributed state of a game based on the concept</abstract>

		<abstract>Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are an increasingly popular class of real-time interactive distributed applications that require scalable architectures and parallelization approaches. While games of the role-playing genre already allow thousands of users to concurrently participate in a single game session, there are important genres, in particular action and strategy games, which have not been scaled to the massively multiplayer</abstract>

		<abstract>Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG) require novel, scalable network architectures for a high amount of participating players in huge game worlds. Consequently, new and complex multi-server parallelization approaches have been proposed to provide responsive, massively multiplayer gameplay for different game genres. Besides scalability and performance, the issue of correctness of the game state processing is vital for providing a failure-free</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper describes a tool that serves as an automatic mesh adaptivity driver program for general purpose finite element (FE) software packages. Many commercially available FE programs lack a feature to control the numerical solution's accuracy properly. Our tool implements a mesh adaptive method that, in conjunction with separate finite element software, allows one to fully automatically improve the quality</abstract>
