		<abstract>The accessible specification of performance queries is a key challenge in performance analysis. To this end, we seek to combine the intuitive aspects of natural language query specification with the expres- sive power and flexibility of the Performance Tree formalism. Specifi- cally, we present a structured English grammar for Performance Trees, and use it to implement a Natural Language Query</abstract>
