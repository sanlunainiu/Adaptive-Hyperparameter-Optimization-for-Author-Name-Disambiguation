		<abstract>Abstract Systems-of-Systems (SoS) represent a novel kind of sys- tem, for which runtime evolution is a key requirement, as components,join and leave during runtime. Current compo- nent integration and verification techniques are not enough in such a dynamic,environment. In this paper we present ATLAS, an architectural framework that enables the run- time integration and verification of a system, based on</abstract>

		<abstract>Despite extensive testing in the development phase, resid- ual defects can be a great threat to dependability in the operational phase. This paper studies the utility of low- cost, generic invariants (&quot;screeners&quot;) in their capacity of error detectors within a spectrum-based fault localization (SFL) approach aimed to diagnose program defects in the operational phase. The screeners considered are simple bit-</abstract>
