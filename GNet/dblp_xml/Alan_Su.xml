		<abstract>In high-level synthesis, resource sharing may result in a circuit containing false loops that create great difficulty in timing validation during the design sign-off phase. It is hence desirable to avoid generating any false loops in a synthesized circuit. Previous work [Stok 1992; Huang et al. 1995] considered mainly data path sharing for false loop elimination. However, for a complete</abstract>
