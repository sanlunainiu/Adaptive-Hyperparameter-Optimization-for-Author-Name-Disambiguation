		<abstract>Limitations in scope but also difficulties with the efficiency and scalability of present algorithms se em to have so far limited the industrial uptake of existi ng automated FMEA technology. In this paper, we describe a new tool for the automatic synthesis of FMEAs which builds upon our earlier work on fault tree synthesi s. The tool constructs FMEAs from</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper proposes the design of an extended DBMS as required for integrated management of urban transportation systems. We introduce an extended `lowest common denominator' database model that supports a wide and varied range of urban transport tasks, which include management, simulation and planning. This paper is the result of research being carried out and is formulated by database expertise</abstract>
