		<abstract>Processable Bulk Data Transfer (PBDT) tasks are resource intensive concurrent tasks which involve transfer of a very large amount of data that has to be processed in some way before it can be used at a remote set of destination nodes called the sink nodes. A distributed computing environment, such as the Grid is a popular way to perform these</abstract>
