		<abstract>The Internet has opened opportunities for ecient on-line trading, and researchers have developed algorithms for various auctions, as well as exchanges for standardized commodities; however, they have done little work on exchanges for complex nonstandard goods. We pro- pose a formal model for trading complex goods, present an exchange system that allows traders to describe purchases and sales by multiple</abstract>

		<abstract>We describe an exchange system for trad- ing complex goods, such as used cars or nonstandard nancial securities. The system allows traders to repre- sent their buy and sell orders by multiple attributes, pro- vide complex price constraints, and specify preferences among acceptable trades. We describe a technique for fast identication of most preferable matches between buy and sell orders,</abstract>
