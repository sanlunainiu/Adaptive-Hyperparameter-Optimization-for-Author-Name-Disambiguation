		<abstract>This paper proposes a novel, hypergraph partitioning based strategy to schedule multiple data analysis tasks with batch- shared I/O behavior. This strategy formulates the sharing of files among tasks as a hypergraph to minimize the I/O over- heads due to transferring of the same set of files multiple times and employs a dynamic scheme for file transfers to re- duce</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we propose to employ two optimizations - multi-hop path splitting and multi-pathing - to improve the performance of data transfers over shared public net- works. We present a path determination algorithm which integrates the aforesaid optimizations in order to improve the performance of single file transfers. Finally, we develop a file transfer scheduling algorithm based on this</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper addresses the problem of efficient execu- tion of a batch of data-intensive tasks with batch-shared I/O behavior, on coupled storage and compute clusters. Two scheduling schemes are proposed: 1) a 0-1 Integer Programming (IP) based approach, which couples task scheduling and data replication, and 2) a bi-level hy- pergraph partitioning based heuristic approach (BiPar- tition), which decouples task</abstract>

		<abstract>Many scientific applications need to stage large vol- umes of files from one set of machines to another set of machines in a wide-area network. Efficient execu- tion of such data transfers needs to take into account the heterogeneous nature of the environment and dy- namic availability of shared resources. This paper pro- poses an algorithm that dynamically schedules a</abstract>

		<abstract>Many scientific investigations have to deal with large amounts of data from simulations and experiments. Data analysis in such inves- tigations typically involves extraction of subsets of data, followed by computations performed on extracted data. Scheduling in this context requires ecient utilization of the computational, storage and network resources to optimize response time. The data-intensive nature of such applications necessitates</abstract>

		<abstract>Data-intensive applications frequently transfer large am ounts of data over wide-area networks. The performance achieved in such settings can often be improved by routing data via intermediate nodes chosen to increase aggregate bandwidth. We explore the benefits of overlay network approa ches by designing and implementing a service-oriented architecture that incorporates two key optimizations - mul ti-hop path splitting and</abstract>
