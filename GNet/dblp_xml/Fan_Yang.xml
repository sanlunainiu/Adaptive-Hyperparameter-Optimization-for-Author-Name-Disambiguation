		<abstract>As a growing number of websites open up their APIs to ex- ternal application developers (e.g., Facebook, Yahoo! Wid- gets, Google Gadgets), these websites are facing an intrigu- ing scalability problem: while each user-generated applica- tion is by itself quite small (in terms of size and through- put requirements), there are many many such applications. Unfortunately, existing data-management solutions are</abstract>

		<abstract>We propose Hilda, a high-level language for developing data-driven web applications. The primary benefits of Hilda over existing development platforms are: (a) it uses a uni- fied data model for all layers of the application, (b) it is declarative, (c) it models both application queries and up- dates, (d) it supports structured programming for web sites, and (e) it enables</abstract>

		<abstract>The XQuery 1.0 and XPath 2.0 Full-text (XQFT) language has been developed by the W3C to extend XQuery and XPath with full-text search capabilities. XQFT allows users to specify a mix of structured and complex full-text predi- cates, and also allows users to score/rank such queries. The power and âˆžexibility of XQFT gives rise to two interest- ing questions. First,</abstract>

		<abstract>Current application development tools provide completely difierent programming models for the application server (e.g., Java and J2EE) and the client web browser (e.g., JavaScript and HTML). Consequently, the application developer is forced to partition the application code between the server and client at the time of writing the application. However, the partitioning of the code between the client and server</abstract>

		<abstract>Emerging applications such as personalized portals, enter- prise search and web integration systems often require key- word search over semi-structured views. However, tradi- tional information retrieval techniques are likely to be ex- pensive in this context because they rely on the assumption that the set of documents being searched is materialized. In this paper, we present a system architecture and</abstract>

		<abstract>Data-driven web applications are usually structured in three tiers with different programming models at each tier. This division forces developers to manually partition application functionality across the tiers, resulting in complex logic, sub- optimal partitioning, and expensive re-partitioning of appli- cations. In this paper, we introduce a unified platform for auto- matic partitioning of data-driven web applications. Our ap- proach</abstract>

		<abstract>An emerging trend in Social Networking sites and Web portals is the opening up of their APIs to external application develop- ers. For example, the Facebook Platform, Google Gadgets and Ya- hoo! Widgets allow developers to design their own applications, which can then can be integrated with the platform and shared with other users. However, current APIs are targeted towards</abstract>
