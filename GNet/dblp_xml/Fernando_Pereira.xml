		<abstract>Subgroup discovery consists in finding subsets of individuals from a given population which have distinctive collective properties with regard to one or more properties of interest. The interest of a subgroup can be objectively assessed using appropriate statistics, but it can also be evaluated by a data analyst or domain expert. In this paper we pro- pose an approach to</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper we introduce distribution rules, a kind of as- sociation rules with a distribution on the consequent. Distribution rules are related to quantitative association rules but can be seen as a more fundamental concept, useful for learning distributions. We formalize the main concepts and indicate applications to tasks such as frequent pattern discovery, sub group discovery and forecasting.</abstract>
