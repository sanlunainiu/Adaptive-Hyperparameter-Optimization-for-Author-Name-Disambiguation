		<abstract>We derive a polynomial time algorithm to compute a stable solution in a mixed matching market from an auction procedure as presented by Eriksson and Karlander (2). As a special case we derive an O(nm) algo- rithm for bipartite matching that does not seem to have appeared in the literature yet.</abstract>
