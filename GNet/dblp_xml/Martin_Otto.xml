		<abstract>In this paper we describe a new algorithm to prevent fault attacks on RSA signature algorithms using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT-RSA). This variant of the RSA signature algorithm is widely used on smartcards. Smartcards on the other hand are particularly susceptible to fault attacks like the one described in [7]. Recent results have shown that fault attacks are practical</abstract>

		<abstract>At CCS 2003, a new CRT-RSA algorithm was presented in (BOS03), which was claimed to be secure against fault attacks for various fault models. At CCS 2004, David Wagner presented an attack on the proposed scheme, claiming that the so-called BOS scheme was insecure for all presented fault models (Wag04). However, the attack itself contains a flaw which shows that</abstract>

		<abstract>We present a new type of fault attacks on elliptic curve scalar multiplications: Sign Change Attacks. These attacks exploit dieren t num- ber representations as they are often employed in modern cryptographic applications. Previously, fault attacks on elliptic curves aimed to force a device to output points which are on a cryptographically weak curve. Such attacks can easily be defended</abstract>
