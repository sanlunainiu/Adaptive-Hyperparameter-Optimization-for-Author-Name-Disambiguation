		<abstract>Dynamic CMOS logic circuits are widely employed in high performance VLSI chips in pursuing very high system performance. However, dynamic circuits are inherently less resistant to noises than static CMOS gates. With the increasing stringent noise requirement due to aggressive technology scaling, the noise tolerance of dynamic circuits has to be first improved for the overall reliable operation of VLSI</abstract>

		<abstract>Crosstalk delay-noise which occurs due to the simultaneous transitions of victim and aggressor drivers is very sensitive to their mutual alignment. Hence, during static noise analysis, it is crucial to identify the worst-case victim-aggressor alignment which results in the maximum delay-noise. Although several approaches have been proposed to obtain the worst-case aggressor alignment, most of them compute only the worst-case</abstract>

		<abstract>Dynamic noise analysis is recently gaining more attention as a definitive method to overcome glaring deficiencies of static noise analysis. Exact dynamic noise analysis requires modeling of both injected noise and propagated noise. In this paper, we have developed a strategy to study the noise propagation problem. An efficient analytical formula has been derived to accurately model the noise waveform</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper describes a fast method to estimate crosstalk noise in the presence of multiple aggressor nets for use in physical design automation tools. Since noise estimation is often part of the innerloop of optimization algorithms, very efficient closed-form solutions are needed. Previous approaches have typically used simple lumped 3--4 node circuit templates. One aggressor net is modeled at a</abstract>

		<abstract>Noise glitches can cause functional errors or failures if they are latched into sequential cells. Thus it is very important to determine or characterize noise failure criteria of sequential cells. However, characterizing noise failure criteria of sequential cells is very computationally expensive because it often requires multiple transient simulations with different clock waveform shapes and alignments, known as clock sweeping.</abstract>

The model contains layers of the original transistors and parasitics around the block boundary. Therefore it</abstract>
