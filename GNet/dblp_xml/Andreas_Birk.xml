		<abstract>Evolutionary game-theory is a powerful tool to investigate the devel- opment of complex relations between individuals such as the emergence of coop- eration and trust. But the propagation of genes is an unrealistic assumption when it comes to model fast-changing social interactions. We show how a transition from evolutionary game-theory to learning can be made. Specifically, we show how cooperation</abstract>

		<abstract>Rescue robotics is an important steppingstone in the scientific chal- lenge to create autonomous systems. There is a significant market for res- cue robots, which has unique features that allow a fruitful combination of application oriented developments and basic research. Unlike other mar- kets for advanced robotics systems like service robots, the rescue robotics domain benefits from the fact that</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract The usability of mobile robots for surveillance, search and rescue missions can be significantly improved,by intelligent functionalities decreasing the cognitive load on the operator or even allowing autonomous operations, e.g., when communication fails. Mobility in this regard is not only a mechatronic problem but also a percep- tion, modeling and planning challenge. Here, the perception issue of detecting driv-</abstract>

		<abstract>We illustrate our experience in developing and implementing algorithms for map merging, i.e., the problem of fusing two or more partial maps without common reference frames into one large global map. The partial maps may for example be acquired by multiple robots, or during several runs of a single robot from varying starting positions. Our work deals with low quality</abstract>
