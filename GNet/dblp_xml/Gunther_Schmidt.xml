		<abstract>The aim of this paper is to extend the approximate quasi-interpolation on a uniform grid by dilated shifts of a smooth and rapidly decaying function on a uniform grid to scattered data quasi-interpolation. It is shown that high order approximation of smooth functions up to some prescribed accuracy is possible, if the basis functions, which are centered at the scattered</abstract>

		<abstract>. The paper studies quasiinterpolation by scaled shifts of a smooth andrapidly decaying function. The centers are images of a smooth mapping of the hZnlattice in Rs, s  n, and the scaling parameters are proportional to h. We show that fora large class of generating functions the quasiinterpolants provide high order approximationsup to some prescribed accuracy. Although the approximants do</abstract>
