		<abstract>Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are expressed in mammalian germline cells and have been identified as key players in germline development. These molecules, typically of length 25-33nt, associate with Piwi proteins of the Argonaute family to form the Piwi-interacting RNA complex. These small regulatory RNAs have been implicated in sperma- togenesis, repression of retrotransposon transposi- tion in germline cells, epigenetic regulation and</abstract>
