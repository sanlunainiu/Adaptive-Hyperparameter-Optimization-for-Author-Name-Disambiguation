As the queries are often short, general or even ambiguous, the images in resulting pages vary in content and style. Thus, browsing with these results is likely to be tedious, frustrating and unpredictable. IGroup, a proposed image search engine addresses these problems by</abstract>

		<abstract>Relevance feedback (RF) has been extensively studied in the content-based image retrieval community. However, no commercial Web image search engines support RF because of scalability, efficiency and effectiveness issues. In this paper we proposed a scalable relevance feedback mechanism using click- through data for web image retrieval. The proposed mechanism regards users' click-through data as implicit feedback which could be</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract Face recognition with variant pose, illumination and expression (PIE) is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an analysis-by-synthesis framework for face recognition with variant PIE. First, an efficient two-dimensional (2D)-to-threedimensional,(3D) integrated face reconstruction approach,is introduced to reconstruct a personalized 3D face model from a single frontal face image with neutral expression and normal illumination. Then, realistic virtual</abstract>

		<abstract>Oriented patterns, e.g. fingerprints, consist of smoothly varying flow-like patterns, together with important singular points (i.e. cores and deltas) where the orientation changes abruptly. Gabor filters and anisotropic diffusion methods have been widely used to enhance oriented patterns. How- ever, none of them can well cope with regions of varying curvatures or regions surrounding singular points. By in- corporating the</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper presents a novel non-local iterative back- projection (NLIBP) algorithm for image enlargement. The iterative back-projection (IBP) technique iteratively reconstructs a high resolution (HR) image from its blurred and downsampled low resolution (LR) counterpart. However, the conventional IBP methods often produce many &quot;jaggy&quot; and &quot;ringing&quot; artifacts because the reconstruction errors are back projected into the reconstructed image isotropically and</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper presents a novel image feature representation method, called multi-texton histogram (MTH), for image retrieval. MTH integrates the advantages of co-occurrence matrix and histogram by representing the attribute of co-occurrence matrix using histogram. It can be considered as a generalized visual attribute descriptor but without any image segmentation or model training. The proposed MTH method is based on Julesz's</abstract>

Using an over-complete wavelet expansion, we group the wavelet coe3cients with the same spatial orientation at several scales. We then apply the linear minimum,mean squared-error estimation to smooth noise. This scheme exploits the inter-scale correlation information of wavelet</abstract>

These dependencies can be exploited to improve the estimation of fBm signals embedded into noise. The idea is to reorganize</abstract>

Effective defect tolerance techniques are essential to improve the yield of such complex,integrated circuits. In this paper, we propose to achieve fault tolerance by employing,redundancy,at the core-level instead of at the microarchitecture-level. When faulty cores existing on-chip in this architecture, how to reconfigure the processor with the most effective topology is a relevant research</abstract>

		<abstract>Topology virtualization techniques are proposed for NoC-based many-core processors with core-level redundancy to isolate hardware changes caused by on-chip defective cores. Prior work focuses on homogeneous cores with symmetric performance and optimizes on-chip communication only. However, core-to-core performance asymmetry due to manufacturing process variations poses new challenges for constructing virtual topologies. Lower performance cores may scatter over a virtual topology,</abstract>
