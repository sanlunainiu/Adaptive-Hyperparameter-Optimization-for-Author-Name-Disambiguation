		<abstract>This paper is concerned with the class imbalance problem which has been known to hinder the learning performance of classification algorithms. The problem occurs when there are significantly less number of observations of the target concept. Various real-world classification tasks, such as medical diagnosis, text categorization and fraud detection suffer from this phenomenon. The standard machine learning algorithms yield better</abstract>

		<abstract>We introduce a multi-stage ensemble framework, Error- Driven Generalist+Expert or Edge, for improved classiflca- tion on large-scale text categorization problems. Edge flrst trains a generalist, capable of classifying under all classes, to deliver a reasonably accurate initial category ranking given an instance. Edge then computes a confusion graph for the generalist and allocates the learning resources to train experts on</abstract>

		<abstract>The issue of seeking efcient and effective methods for classifying unstructured text in large document corpora has received much attention in recent years. Traditional document representation like bag-of-words encodes docu- ments as feature vectors, which usually leads to sparse fea- ture spaces with large dimensionality, thus making it hard to achieve high classication accuracies. This paper ad- dresses the problem</abstract>

		<abstract>Name ambiguity is a special case of identity uncertainty where one person can be referenced by multiple name vari- ations in different situations or even share the same name with other people. In this paper, we focus on the problem of disambiguating person names within web pages and sci- entific documents. We present an efficient and effective two- stage approach</abstract>

		<abstract>In many multiclass learning scenarios, the number of classes is relatively large (thousands,...), or the space and time efficiency of the learning system can be crucial. We investigate two online up- date techniques especially suited to such problems. These updates share a sparsity preservation capacity: they allow for constraining the number of prediction connections that each feature can make. We</abstract>

		<abstract>We propose a novel multiclass classiflcation algorithm Gen- tle Adaptive Multiclass Boosting Learning (GAMBLE). The algorithm naturally extends the two class Gentle AdaBoost algorithm to multiclass classiflcation by using the multi- class exponential loss and the multiclass response encoding scheme. Unlike other multiclass algorithms which reduce the K-class classiflcation task to K binary classiflcations, GAMBLE handles the task directly and</abstract>

Recent research shows that implicit feedback regarding user preferences can be extracted from web access logs in order to increase ranking performance.

Many techniques explicitly accounting for this language style discrepancy have shown promising results for information retrieval, yet a large scale analysis on the extent of the language differences has been lacking.
