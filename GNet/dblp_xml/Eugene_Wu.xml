		<abstract>Advances in data acquisition and sensor technologies are leading towards the development of &quot;high fan-in&quot; architectures: widely distributed systems whose edges consist of numerous receptors such as sensor networks, RFID readers, or probes, and whose interior nodes are traditional host computers organized using the principles of cascading streams and successive aggregation. Examples include RFID-enabled supply chain management, large- scale environmental</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evalua- tion of a system that executes complex event queries over real-time streams of RFID readings encoded as events. These complex event queries filter and correlate events to match specific patterns, and transform the relevant events into new composite events for the use of external monitoring applications. Stream-based execution of these</abstract>

		<abstract>The World-Wide Web consists of a huge number of unstruc- tured hypertext documents, but it also contains structured data in the form of HTML tables. Many of these tables contain both relational-style data and a small &quot;schema&quot; of labeled and typed columns, making each such table a small structured database. The WebTables project is an effort to extract and make</abstract>

		<abstract>The wide deployment of wireless sensor and RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) devices is one of the key en- ablers for next-generation pervasive computing applications, including large-scale environmental monitoring and control, context-aware computing, and &quot;smart digital homes&quot;. Sensory readings are inherently unreliable and typically exhibit strong temporal and spatial correlations (within and across different sensing devices); effective reasoning over such unreliable</abstract>

		<abstract>The World-Wide Web consists of a huge number of unstruc- tured documents, but it also contains structured data in the form of HTML tables. We extracted 14.1 billion HTML ta- bles from Google's general-purpose web crawl, and used sta- tistical classification techniques to find the estimated 154M that contain high-quality relational data. Because each re- lational table has its own</abstract>
