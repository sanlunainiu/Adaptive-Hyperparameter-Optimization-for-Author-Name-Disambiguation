		<abstract>The ability to update the structure of a Bayesian net- work when new data becomes available is crucial for building adaptive systems. Recent work by Sang, Beame, and Kautz (AAAI 2005) demonstrates that the well-known Davis-Putnam procedure combined with a dynamic decomposition and caching technique is an ef- fective method for exact inference in Bayesian networks with high ...</abstract>

		<abstract>Phrasal Verbs are an important feature of the English language. Properly identifying them provides the basis for an English parser to decode the related structures. Phrasal verbs have been a challenge to Natural Language Processing (NLP) because they sit at the borderline between lexicon and syntax. Traditional NLP frameworks that separate the lexicon module from the parser make it difficult</abstract>

		<abstract>A mission of chemical plume tracing (CPT) is to navigate an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to find a chemical plume, to trace the plume to its source, and to declare the source location. This paper presents a multisensor integration strategy for source declaration subsumed in a behavior based control architecture with several individual behaviors. The performance of the proposed strategy</abstract>

		<abstract>Online traffic classification continues to be of long- term interest to the networking community. It serves as the input for practical solutions such as network monitoring, quality- of-service and intrusion-detection. In this paper we present a machine-learning approach that accurately classifies internet traffic using C4.5 decision tree. Accuracy is not our only concern; the latency and throughput are also of</abstract>

		<abstract>Many data mining tasks (e.g., Association Rules, Sequen- tial Patterns) use complex pointer-based data structures (e.g., hash trees) that typically suffer from sub-optimal data local- ity. In the multiprocessor case shared access to these data structures may also result in false sharing. For these tasks it is commonly observed that the recursive data structure is built once and accessed multiple</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract. Many powerful parallelizing compiler techniques rely on the structures of data and code. Unfortunately, in many real applications, arrays do not have syntactic structures. In this paper, we show that logical da ta structures can be automatically recovered from the flat, one-dimensional arr ays and accesses. We present a framework,and algorithms for recovering the logic al multi-dimensional data structures.</abstract>

In this context, several techniques have been proposed for auto-parallelization of programs. Recently, thread-level speculation (TLS) has been proposed as a means to parallelize difficult-to-analyze serial codes. In general, more than one technique can</abstract>

Several parallel and sequential algorithms have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem.

We study the degree of parallelism, synchroniza- tion, and data locality issues, and present optimizations for fast frequency computation. Experiments show that a signicant improvement of performance is achieved using our proposed optimizations. We also achieved good speed-up for the parallel algorithm.</abstract>

		<abstract>In scalable parallel machines, processors can make local memory accesses much faster than they can make remote memory accesses. Additionally, when a number of remote accesses must be made, it is usually more efficient to use block transfers of data rather than to use many small messages. To run well on such machines, software must exploit these features. We believe</abstract>
