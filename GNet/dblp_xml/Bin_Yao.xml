		<abstract>This work presents a novel index structure, MHR- tree, for efficiently answering approximate string match queries in large spatial databases. The MHR-tree is based on the R-tree augmented with the min-wise signature and the linear hashing technique. The min-wise signature for an index node u keeps a concise representation of the union of q-grams from strings under the sub-tree of</abstract>

		<abstract>Given a set of points P and a query point q, the reverse furthest neighbor (RFN) query fetches the set of points p 2 P such that q is their furthest neighbor among all points in P ({q}. This is the monochromatic RFN (MRFN) query. Another interesting version of RFN query is the bichromatic reverse furthest neighbor (BRFN) query. Given</abstract>

		<abstract>Finding the k nearest neighbors (kNN) of a query point, or a set of query points (kNN-Join) are fundamental problems in many application domains. Many previous efforts to solve these problems focused on spatial databases or stand-alone systems, where changes to the database engine may be required, which may limit their application on large data sets that are stored in</abstract>
