		<abstract>In this contribution, a power allocation game for multi- ple input multiple output multiple access channels is pro- vided. Considering competing transmitting users, equipped with several antennas each and common multiple antennas at the receiver (base station), a game theoretic framework is conducted to analyze the optimum precoding matrices (power allocation and eigenvector transmit structure) such that each user maximizes</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper investigates the situation where a (large) group of terminals can be connected simultaneously to several base stations using distinct wireless technologies. We introduce and solve the problem of optimally sharing the mobile trans- mit power between different systems. Key results from asymp- totic random matrix theory (when the number of users and the dimensions of different systems increase)</abstract>

		<abstract>This paper investigates the situation where a group of terminals can be simul- taneously connected to several base stations using distinct technologies on non- overlapping frequency bands. We introduce and solve the problem of optimal power allocation (in the sense of the ergodic sum-rate) for the terminals in the uplink, using three types of receivers: the optimum receiver, minimum mean</abstract>
