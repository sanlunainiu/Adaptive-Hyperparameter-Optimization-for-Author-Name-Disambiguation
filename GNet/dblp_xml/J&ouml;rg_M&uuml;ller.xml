		<abstract>In recent years, autonomous miniature airships have gained increased interest in the robotics community. This is due to their ability to move safely and hover for extended periods of time. The major constraints of miniature airships come from their limited payload which introduces substantial constraints on their perceptional capabilities. In this paper, we consider the problem of localizing a miniature</abstract>
