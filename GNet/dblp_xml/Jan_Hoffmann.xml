		<abstract>Given a binary dominance relation on a set of alternatives, a common thread in the social sciences is to identify subsets of alternatives that satisfy certain notions of stability. Examples can be found in areas as diverse as voting theory, game theory, and argumentation theory. Brandt and Fischer (BF08) proved that it is NP-hard to decide whether an alternative is</abstract>

		<abstract>Resolution refinements called w-resolution trees with lemmas (WRTL) and with input lemmas (WRTI) are introduced. Dag-like resolution is equivalent to both WRTL and WRTI when there is no regularity con- dition. For regular proofs, an exponential separation between regular dag-like resolution and both regular WRTL and regular WRTI is given. It is proved that DLL proof search algorithms that use</abstract>

		<abstract>Let R be a resolution refutation, given as a sequence of clauses without explicit description of the underlying dag. Then, it is NP- complete to decide whether R is a regular resolution refutation.</abstract>
