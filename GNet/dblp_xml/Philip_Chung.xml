		<abstract>A major domain of inquiry in human-computer interaction is the execution of routine procedures. We have collected extensive data on human execution of two procedures which are structurally isomorphic, but not visually isomorphic. Extant control approaches (e.g., GOMS) predicts they should have the same execution time and error rate profiles, which they do not. We present a series of ACT-R</abstract>
