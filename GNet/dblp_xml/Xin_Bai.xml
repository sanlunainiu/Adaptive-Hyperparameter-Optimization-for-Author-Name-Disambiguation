		<abstract>Hospital and clinical environments are moving towards computerisation, digitisation and centralisation, resulting in prohibitive amounts of digital medical image data. Compression techniques are, therefore, essential in archival and communication of medical image. Although lossy compression yields much higher compression rates, the medical community has relied on lossless compression for legal and clinical reasons. In this paper, we propose a segmentation-based</abstract>
