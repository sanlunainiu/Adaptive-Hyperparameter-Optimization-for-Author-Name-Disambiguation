		<abstract>This paper focuses on fundamental similarities between proposing links for hypertexts and predicting user-requests. It briefly outlines the theoreti- cal background of both categories of problems and, as an example, explores common implementation strategies for handling them. Even though there are some important differences between link-proposals and prediction of requests, we believe that in regarding these categories as special cases</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, several problems in associating hyperlinks to text and the diverse possibilities to overcome these problems are discussed. At the cur- rent stage, an important aspect is knowledge retrieval of hypertexts. Our ad- vanced studies on hyperlink management focus mainly on a concept similar to Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) systems as a possibility for the automatic genera- tion of</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we will discuss the problem of proposing links for hypertexts based on Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) techniques. These proposals can be used in addition to traditional textual based methods. At first, we will focus on the basic ideas of CBR. Next, its modeling for Hyperlink-Management Systems will be discussed, and finally the usefulness of CBR in the area</abstract>

		<abstract>Modern security architectures tend to become more and more complex. Not only the chances to improve Web applications using several data channels and diverse (TCP-)ports are very promising, but also the risks for criminal attacks and an intrusion into the corporate network are increasing. The classical solution to protect networks against criminal attacks with firewalls is problematic, though. On the</abstract>

		<abstract>Since online-available documents are more and more outclassing p aper based documents, the use of online references is constantly growing. Online references suffer strongly from their often only temporarily character. With the slightest modification - not to mention a complete removal of its online references - the scientific value of the referencing document would decline. Therefore, mechanisms are needed that</abstract>

For that reason we report the conception of a gateway that works as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) service which is based on a public key infrastructure (PKI). The developed service consists of the signing of any data-transmission that was</abstract>
