		<abstract>We develop an expression for the minimum extra bandwidth needed for a frequency-division multiple-access (FDMA) system to out- perform its code-division (CDMA) counterpart uniformly (that is, for all rate -tuples) in a Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC). For equal- power sources, the behavior of this factor is as an iterated logarithm of the number of users; hence it increases slowly yet</abstract>

		<abstract>Page's test is optimal for detecting a permanent change in distribution, in the sense that it minimizes the worst case average delay to detection given an average distance between false alarms. When used to detect transient signals, however, it in fact becomes the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Since a GLRT is in almost all cases ad hoc, Page's test</abstract>
