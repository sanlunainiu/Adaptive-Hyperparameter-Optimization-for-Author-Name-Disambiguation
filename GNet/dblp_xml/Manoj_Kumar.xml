		<abstract>In recent years, a number of requirements engineering (RE) proposals for a data warehouse (DW) systems have been made. In the traditional/operational systems, requirements engineering has been divided into two phases: early &amp;amp; late requirements engineering phase. Most of the data warehouse requirements engineering (DWRE) approaches have not distinguished early requirements engineering phase from late requirements engineering phase. A very</abstract>
