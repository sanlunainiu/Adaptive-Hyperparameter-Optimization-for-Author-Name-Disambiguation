		<abstract>Development of algorithms for automated text categorization in massive text document sets is an important research area of data mining and knowledge discovery. Most of the text-clustering methods were grounded in the term-based measurement of distance or similarity, ignoring the structure of terms in documents. In this paper we present a novel method named Structured Cosine Similarity that furnishes document</abstract>
