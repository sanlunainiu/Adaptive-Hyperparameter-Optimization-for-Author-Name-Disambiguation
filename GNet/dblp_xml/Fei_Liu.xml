		<abstract>A context management system is a distributed system that enables applications to obtain context information about (mobile) users and forms a key component of any pervasive computing environment. Context management systems are however very environment-specific (e.g., specific for home environments) and therefore do not interoperate very well. This limits the operation of context-aware applications because they cannot get context information</abstract>

		<abstract>A protocol for service discovery using attenuated Bloom filters has been proposed for ad-hoc networks. Based on our study, it can well save network bandwidth compared to conventional approaches. We have built both an analytical model and a simulation model to evaluate the performance of our novel discovery mechanism. A comparison of these two models shows that the analytical model</abstract>

		<abstract>A novel approach to performing context discovery in ad-hoc net- works based on the use of attenuated Bloom filters is proposed in this paper. In order to investigate the performance of this approach, a model has been devel- oped. This document describes the model and its validation. The model has been implemented in Matlab, and some results are also shown</abstract>
