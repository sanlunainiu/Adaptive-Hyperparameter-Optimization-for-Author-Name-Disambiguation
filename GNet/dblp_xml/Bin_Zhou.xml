		<abstract>Recently, privacy preserving data publishing has received a lot of attention in both research and applications. Most of the previous studies, however, focus on static data sets. In this paper, we study an emerging problem of continuous pri- vacy preserving publishing of data streams which cannot be solved by any straightforward extensions of the existing pri- vacy preserving publishing methods</abstract>

		<abstract>Keyword search has been recently extended to relational databases to retrieve information from text-rich attributes. However, all the existing methods focus on flnding individ- ual tuples matching a set of query keywords from one table or the join of multiple tables. In this paper, we motivate a novel problem of aggregate keyword search: flnding mini- mal group-bys covering a set</abstract>

		<abstract>Recently, as more and more social network data has been published in one way or another, preserving privacy in publishing social network data becomes an important con- cern. With some local knowledge about individuals in a social network, an adversary may attack the privacy of some victims easily. Unfortunately, most of the previous studies on privacy preservation can deal with</abstract>

		<abstract>ABSTRACT Search logs, which contain rich and up-to-date information about usersâ€™ needs and preferences, have become a critical data source for search engines. Recently, more and more data-driven applications are being developed in search en- gines based on search logs, such as query suggestion, key- word bidding, and dissatisfactory query analysis. In this paper, by observing that many data-driven applications</abstract>

		<abstract>The Web is a very large social network. It is important and interesting to understand the \ecology&quot; of the Web: the general relations of Web pages to their environment. The understanding of such relations has a few important applications, including Web community identiflcation and analysis, and Web spam detection. In this paper, we propose the notion of page farm, which</abstract>

		<abstract>Web spam, which refers to any deliberate actions bringing to selected web pages an unjustiflable favorable relevance or importance, is one of the major obstacles for high quality information retrieval on the web. Most of the existing web spam detection methods are supervised that require a large and representative training set of web pages. Moreover, they often assume some global</abstract>

		<abstract>Nowadays, partly driven by many Web 2.0 applications, more and more social network data has been made publicly available and analyzed in one way or another. Privacy pre- serving publishing of social network data becomes a more and more important concern. In this paper, we present a brief yet systematic review of the existing anonymization techniques for privacy preserving publishing</abstract>

		<abstract>Currently, most popular Web search engines adopt some link-based ranking methods such as PageRank. Driven by the huge potential benefit of improving rankings of Web pages, many tricks have been attempted to boost page rankings. The most common way, which is known as link spam, is to make up some artificially designed link structures. Detecting link spam effectively is a</abstract>
