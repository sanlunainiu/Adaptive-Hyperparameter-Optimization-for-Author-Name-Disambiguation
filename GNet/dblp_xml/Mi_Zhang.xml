		<abstract>In Electronic Design Automation, current system-level design languages (e.g. SystemC) are all built from static languages (C/C++), and the design methodology is static. (1)This could lead to much inefficiency in description, verification, and synthesis. We have created the world's first Dynamic System-level Design Language (PDSDL [1]) by using popular dynamic language python, and a refining framework (Trilobite [2]) based on</abstract>
