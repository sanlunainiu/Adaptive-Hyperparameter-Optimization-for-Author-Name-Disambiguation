		<abstract>In software with emergent properties, despite the best efforts to remove faults before execution, there is a high likelihood that faults will occur during runtime. These faults can lead to unacceptable program behavior during execution, even leading to the program terminating unexpectedly. Using a distributed event-driven runtime software-fault monitor to repair faulty states creates an enforceable runtime specification. Using such</abstract>
