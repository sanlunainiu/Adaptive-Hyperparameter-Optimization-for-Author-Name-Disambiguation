		<abstract>Intrinsic curvature flows can be used to design Riemannian metrics by prescribed curvatures. This chapter presents three discrete curvature flow methods that are recently introduced into the engineer- ing fields: the discrete Ricci flow and discrete Yamabe flow for surfaces with various topology, and the discrete curvature flow for hyperbolic 3- manifolds with boundaries. For each flow, we introduce its</abstract>

In this paper we propose to use conformal mapping to compute a new em- bedding of the sensor nodes in the plane such that greedy for- warding with the virtual coordinates guarantees delivery. In particular, we extract a planar triangulation of the sensor net-</abstract>

		<abstract>Surface classification is one of the most fundamental proble ms in geometric modeling. Surfaces can be classified according to their conformal structures. In general, each topological e quiv- alent class has infinite conformally equivalent classes. This paper introduces a novel method to classify surfaces by their conformal structures.

		<abstract>Surface parameterization refers to the process of mapping the surface to canonical planar domains, which plays crucial roles in texture mapping and shape analysis purposes. Most existing techniques focus on simply connected surfaces. It is a challenging problem for multiply connected genus zero surfaces. This work generalizes conventional Koebe's method for multiply connected planar domains. According to Koebe's uniformization theory,</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract—This work introduces a unified framework for discrete surface Ricci flow algorithms, including spherical, euclidean, and hyperbolic Ricci flows, which can design Riemannian metrics on surfaces with arbitrary topologies by user-defined Gaussian curvatures. Furthermore, the target metrics are conformal (angle-preserving) to the original metrics. Ricci flow conformally deforms the Riemannian metric on a surface according to its induced curvature, such</abstract>

		<abstract>Mesh parameterization is a fundamental technique in computer graphics. The major goals during mesh parameterization are to minimize both the angle distortion and the area distortion. Angle distortion can be eliminated by the use of conformal mapping, in principle. Our paper focuses on solving the problem of finding the best discrete conformal mapping that also minimizes area distortion. First, we</abstract>
