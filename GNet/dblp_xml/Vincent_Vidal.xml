		<abstract>Interactive volume rendering methods such as texture-based slicing techniques and ray-casting have been well developed in recent years. The rendering performance is generally restricted by the volume size, the fill-rate and the tex- ture fetch speed of the graphics hardware. For most 3D data sets, a fraction of the volume is empty, which will reduce the rendering performance without specific</abstract>
