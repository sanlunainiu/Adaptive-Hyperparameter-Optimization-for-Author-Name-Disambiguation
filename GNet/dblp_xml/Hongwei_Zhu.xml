		<abstract>Technological advances such as Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) have increased the feasibility and importance of effectively integrating information from an ever widening number of systems within and across enterprises. A key difficulty of achieving this goal comes from the pervasive heterogeneity in all levels of information systems. A robust solution to this problem needs to be adaptable, extensible, and scalable.</abstract>

		<abstract>The potential benefits of Web services composition heavily rely on semantic interoperability, i.e., the ability to exchange data meaningfully amongst Web services. Context heterogeneity, which refers to different implicit assumptions about interpreting the exchanged data, hampers the automatic composition of Web services. However, existing initiatives of Semantic Web Services (SWSs) often ignore context heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce an</abstract>

		<abstract>The underlying assumptions for interpreting the meaning of data of- ten change over time, which further complicates the problem of semantic het- erogeneities among autonomous data sources. As an extension to the Context Interchange (COIN) framework, this paper introduces the notion of temporal context as a formalization of the problem. We represent temporal context as a multi-valued method in F-Logic;</abstract>

		<abstract>Changes of semantics in data sources further complicate the semantic heterogeneity problem. We identify four types of semantic heterogeneities re- lated to changing semantics and present a solution based on an extension to the Context Interchange (COIN) framework. Changing semantics is represented as multi-valued contextual attributes in a shared ontology; however, only a single value is valid over a certain</abstract>

These chal- lenges exist in the use of an individual data source and are further compounded with the integration of multi- ple sources.

		<abstract>The web has become the largest data repository on the planet. An important factor contributing to its success is its openness and ease of use: anyone can contribute data to, and consume data from, the Web.

		<abstract>Data quality issues have taken on increasing importance in recent years. In our research, we have discovered that many &quot;data quality&quot; problems are actually &quot;data misinterpretation&quot; problems - that is, problems caused by heterogeneous data semantics. In this paper, we first identify semantic heterogeneities that, when not resolved, often cause data quality problems. We discuss the especially challenging problem of</abstract>

		<abstract>Sell Globally&quot; and &quot;Shop Globally&quot; have been seen as a potential benefit of web-enabled electronic business. One important step toward realizing this benefit is to know how things are selling in various parts of the world. A global price comparison service would address this need. But there have not been many such services. In this paper, we use a case</abstract>
