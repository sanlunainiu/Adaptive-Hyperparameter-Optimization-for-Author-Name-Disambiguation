		<abstract>Context-awareness is essential to the development of adaptive information systems. Much work has been done on developing technologies and systems that are aware of absolute location in space and time; other aspects of context have been relatively neglected. We describe our approach to automatically sensing and recognising environmental noise as a contextual cue for context-aware applications. Environmental noise provides much</abstract>

		<abstract>The acoustic environment provides a rich source of information on the types of activity, communication modes, and people involved in many situations. It can be accurately classified using recordings from microphones commonly found in PDAs and other consumer devices. We describe a prototype HMM-based acoustic environment classifier incorporating an adaptive learning mechanism and a hierarchical classification model. Experimental results show</abstract>
