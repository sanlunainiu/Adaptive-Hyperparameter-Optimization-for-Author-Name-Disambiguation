		<abstract>Assuming an insecure quantum channel and an authenti- cated classical channel, we propose an unconditionally secure scheme for encrypting classical messages under a shared key, where attempts to eavesdrop the ciphertext can be detected. If no eavesdropping is de- tected, we can securely re-use the entire key for encrypting new messages. If eavesdropping is detected, we must discard a number</abstract>
