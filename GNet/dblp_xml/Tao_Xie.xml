		<abstract>Summary: ACGT (a comparative genomics tool) is a genomic DNA sequence comparison viewer and analyzer. It can read a pair of DNA sequences in GenBank, Embl or Fasta formats, with or without a comparison file, and provide users with many options to view and analyze the similarities between the input sequences. It is written in Java and can be run</abstract>
