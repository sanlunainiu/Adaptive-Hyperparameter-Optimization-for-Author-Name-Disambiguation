		<abstract>producers and consumers according to some adequate re-source management strategy. In this paper, we consider parallel tasks scheduling prob-lems for hierarchical decentralized systems that consist of homogeneous computational resources such as clusters, PCs and supercomputers, and geographically dispersed. We concentrate on two-level hierarchy scheduling: at the first level, broker allocates computational tasks to the re-source. At the second level, each</abstract>
