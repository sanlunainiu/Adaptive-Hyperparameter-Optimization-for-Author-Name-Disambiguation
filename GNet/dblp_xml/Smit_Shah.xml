		<abstract>Large cluster-based cloud computing platforms increasingly use commodity Ethernet technologies, such as Gigabit Ethernet, 10GigE, and Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), for intra-cluster communication. Traffic congestion can become a performance concern in the Ethernet due to consolidation of data, storage, and control traffic over a common layer-2 fabric, as well as consolidation of multiple virtual machines (VMs) over less physical</abstract>
