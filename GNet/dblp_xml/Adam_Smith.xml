		<abstract>We study the following tiling problem in d dimensions: given a d-dimensional rectangular array of non-negative numbers and an integer p, partition the array into at most p rectangular subarrays so that the maximum weight of any subarray is minimized; the weight of a subarray is the sum of its elements. The rectangular tiling problem is motivated by applications in</abstract>

		<abstract>We study the problem of tracking a moving device under two indoor location architectures: an active mobile architecture and a passive mobile architecture. In the former, the infrastructure has receivers at known locations, which estimate distances to a mobile device based on an active transmission from the device. In the latter, the infrastructure has active beacons that periodically transmit signals</abstract>
