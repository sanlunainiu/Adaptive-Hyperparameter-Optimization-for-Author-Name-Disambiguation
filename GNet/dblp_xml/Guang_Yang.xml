		<abstract>Real-time streaming over wireless links is challenging. The streaming protocol must be efficient and robust to ran- dom wireless loss, fair to itself, and friendly to legacy TCP. Various solutions have been proposed in the liter- ature, among which the Video Transport Protocol (VTP), TFRC Wireless, and MULTFRC are end-to-end representa- tives. In this paper we provide an in-depth comparison</abstract>

		<abstract>Low-rate TCP-targeted Denial-of-Service (DoS) at- tacks aim at the fact that most operating systems in use today have a common base TCP Retransmission Timeout (RTO) of 1 sec. An attacker injects periodic bursts of packets to fill the bottle- neck queue and forces TCP connections to timeout with near-zero throughput. This paper proposes randomization on TCP RTO as defense against</abstract>

		<abstract>Real-time video streaming with rate adaptation to network load/congestion represents an e-cient solution to its coexistence with conventional TCP data services. Naturally, the streaming rate control must be e-cient, smooth and TCP friendly. As multimedia clients be- come mobile, these properties must be preserved also over wireless links. In particular, they must be robust to random wireless losses. Existing schemes</abstract>

With the increasing popularity of asym- metric link technologies (such as DSL, 1xRTT, and satellite links), it is desirable to have a capacity estimation technique, which can simulta- neously measure forward and backward direction link capacities on an Internet path. Moreover, this estimation must often be &quot;sender only&quot;,</abstract>

		<abstract>TCP is the most widely used transport layer pro- tocol. However, it was designed for wired networks and suf- fers performance degradation in error-prone wireless networks. When multiple error losses occur in the same window, existing NewReno-based TCP variants need one RTT to retransmit each lost packet, an inefficient recover strategy. Exponential retransmit backoff and frequent window reduction also lead</abstract>

		<abstract>Knowledge of end-to-end path capacity is useful for video/audio stream adaptation, network management and overlay design. Capacity estimation in wired and last-hop wireless networks has been extensively investigated, but a thorough and systematic study in ad hoc, multihop wireless networks is still lacking. Yet the rate of a wireless link can change dynamically (and rapidly) due to changes in interference,</abstract>
