		<abstract>Although many of the software engineering activities can now be model-supported, the model is often missing in soft- ware development. We are interested in retrieving state- machine models from black-box software components. We assume that the details of the development process of such components (third-party software or COTS) are not avail- able. To adequately support software engineering activi- ties, we</abstract>

		<abstract>The design of complex systems, e.g., telecom services, is usu- ally based on the integration of components (COTS). When components come from third party sources, their internal structure is usually un- known and the documentation is scant or inadequate. Our work addresses the issue of providing a sound support to com- ponent integration in the absence of formal models. We</abstract>

		<abstract>Verification of a modular system composed of communicating components is a difficult problem, especially when the models of the components are not available. Conventional testing techniques are not efficient in detecting erroneous interactions of components because such interactions often occur as interleavings of events that are difficult to reproduce in a modular system. The problem of detecting intermittent errors in</abstract>

		<abstract>As communications networks are expanding to larger areas the control and maintenance of routing information are becoming a formidable task. To cope with its size and complexity and to make the network reliable and scalable hierarchical network has been proposed with new features to support the information infrastructure. However, the network hierarchy adds more complications to the network design and</abstract>

		<abstract>We investigate the use of parameterized state machine mod- els to drive integration testing, in the case where the models of compo- nents are not available beforehand. Therefore, observations from tests are used to learn partial models of components, from which further tests can be derived for integration. We have extended previous algorithms to the case of finite state models</abstract>

		<abstract>The design of complex systems, e.g., telecom services, is nowadays usually based on the integration of components (COTS), loosely coupled in distributed architectures. When components come from third party sources, their internal structure is usually unknown and the documentation is insufficient. Therefore, the system integrator faces the problem of providing a required system assembling COTS whose behaviour is barely specified</abstract>

		<abstract>The analysis of security incidents and frauds has shown that several vulnerabilities of IT systems are due to loopholes in the policies and procedures adopted by organizations as well as in their structure. Organizations have thus to address security and dependability issues by analyzing their organizational setting. In this paper, we present a methodology to support the deployment of Security</abstract>
