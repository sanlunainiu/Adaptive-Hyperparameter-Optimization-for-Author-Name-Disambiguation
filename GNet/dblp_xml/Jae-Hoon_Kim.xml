		<abstract>For the maintenance of a switching system, many levels of expert's decisions may be required to find a correct cause and its appropriate repair procedure. Output messages generated by our switching system, called TDX-1A, for the maintenances have, in general, the following characteristics:A bunch of maintenance messages generated only by even not many trouble/faults make it hard for an operator</abstract>

		<abstract>High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) uses a shared forward link packet data channel that can achieve peak data rates upto 14.4 Mbps. The newly introduced features that are key to reaching such high rates are link adaptation, Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) and fast scheduling. The decision to admit new users is still taken by the Radio Network Controller (RNC); however the</abstract>

		<abstract>CDMA 1x Ev-DO is an evolution of the CDMA2000 3G wireless standard to enable high rate packet data services up to 2.4Mbps in Rev 0, 3.1Mbps in Rev A, and 4.9Mbps in Rev B. To support such high data rates, CDMA 1x Ev-DO utilizes TDMA technology on the downlink allowing a single receiver per time slot. Accordingly, a scheduling algorithm</abstract>

		<abstract>Increasing demand for high data-rate multimedia services has led to the emergence of high-speed data transfer features such as High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) for WCDMA networks. The role of the MAC-hs scheduler is vital in HSDPA in improving overall system performance. Using Opportunistic scheduling to exploit multi-user diversity for efficient transmission of best effort services or considering user fairness</abstract>
