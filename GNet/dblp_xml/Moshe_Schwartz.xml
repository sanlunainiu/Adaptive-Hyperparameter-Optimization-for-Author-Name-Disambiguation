		<abstract>An explicit algorithm is presented for testing whether two non-directed graphs are isomorphic or not. It is shown that for a graph of n vertices, the number of n independent operations needed for the test is polynomial in n. A proof that the algorithm actually performs the test is presented.</abstract>
