		<abstract>Granular computing has impact on development methods in such areas as knowledge discovery and data mining. This paper flrstly presents a new axiomatic deflnition of knowledge granularity, then gives a series of methods of measuring knowledge granularity including concrete measurements lacking parameters and general measurements with para- meters. Furthermore, several combinatorial forms of difierent granularity formulas are described. The principal</abstract>
