		<abstract>It is maintained that to exploit fully the parallelism inherent in animate vision systems, an integrated vision architecture must support multiple models of parallelism. To support this claim, the hardware base of a typical animate vision laboratory and the software requirements of applications are described. A brief overview is then given of the Psyche operating system, which was designed to</abstract>

		<abstract>Animate vision systems couple computer vision and robotics to achieve robust and accurate vision, as well as other complex be- havior. These systems combine low-level sensory processing and effector output with high-level cognitive planning-all computa- tionally intensive tasks that can benefit from parallel processing. A typical animate vision application will likely consist of many tasks, each of which may require</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper we construct a framework that enables us to make class predictions about telecommunication companies' financial performances. We have two goals: to validate our methodology and, using it, to gain insights in this relatively new and very sensitive industry: the telecommunications sector. We have obtained high accuracy rates for the classification models, and small differences between training and</abstract>
