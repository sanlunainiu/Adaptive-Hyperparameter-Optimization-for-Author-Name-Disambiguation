		<abstract>Peer-to-Peer networks are comprised of multiple indepen- dently administered computers (peers) that cooperate via a common protocol in order to achieve a goal common to the peers. Helping the user find relevant information in a P2P network is the subject of the field of Peer-to-Peer IR. In order to be successful, a P2P-IR system needs to be adaptive in several</abstract>

		<abstract>Benchmarking has always been a crucial problem in content-based image retrieval (CBIR). A key issue is the lack of a common access method to retrieval systems, such as SQL for relational databases. The Multimedia Retrieval Mark-up Language (MRML) solves this problem by standardizing access to CBIR systems (CBIRSs). Other difficult problems are also shortly addressed, such as obtaining relevance judgments</abstract>

		<abstract>Relevance feedback has been shown to be a very effec- tive tool for enhancing retrieval results in text retrieval. In content-based image retrieval it is more and more fre- quently used and very good results have been obtained. However, too much negative feedback may destroy a query as good features get negative weightings. This paper compares a variety of strategies</abstract>

		<abstract>This article presents the animated visual 3D program-ming language SAM (Solid Agents in Motion) for parallel systems specification and animation. A SAM program is a set of interacting agents synchronously exchanging mes-sages. The agent's behavior is specified by means of pro-duction rules with a condition and a sequence of actions each. Actions are linearly ordered and execute when matching a</abstract>

The concepts transforming SDL interaction and process diagrams into Timed PJ are outlined by</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract The latest OCL 2.0 proposal provides two semantic descriptions, i.e., a metamodelbased semantics that uses UML itself to associate the semantic domain with the language concepts and a formal semantics based on a set-theoretic approach called object model. Unfortunately, these two semantics are currently neither consistent nor complete, as (a) the formal semantics does not consider the newly introduced</abstract>
