		<abstract>Various regression test selection techniques have been developed and have shown fault detection effectiveness. The majority of these test selection techniques rely on access to source code for change identification. However, when new releases of COTS components are made available for integration and testing, source code is often not available. In this paper we present a lightweight Integrated - Black-box</abstract>

		<abstract>Multi-core CPUs are now common in modern computers. To get access to effectively an unlimited supply of compute resources, software programs that have been highly optimized to use a single CPU need to be converted where possible to use concurrency. We have initiated our concurrency software research for performance enhancement on a large-scale system with high throughput and low latency</abstract>

		<abstract>Software testing is an integral part of the software development process. Some software developers, particularly those who use the Extreme Programming test- driven development practice, continuously write automated tests to verify their code. We present a tool to complement the feedback loops created by continuous testing. The tool combines static source code metrics with dynamic test coverage for use throughout</abstract>

		<abstract>Predictive multiplexed switching is a new approach for building interconnection switches for high perfor- mance parallel systems. This approach advocates sacrific- ing some link bandwidth in return for more efficient network control and simpler connection management. The main idea is to depart from the traditional packet and worm- hole switching in favor of row data communication over established communication pipes</abstract>
