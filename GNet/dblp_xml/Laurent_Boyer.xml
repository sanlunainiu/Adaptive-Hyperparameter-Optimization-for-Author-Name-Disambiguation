		<abstract>The problem of learning metrics between structured data (strings, trees or graphs) has been the subject of various recent papers. With regard to the specific case of trees, some approaches focused on the learning of edit probabilities required to compute a so-called stochas- tic tree edit distance. However, to reduce the algorithmic and learning constraints, the deletion and insertion operations</abstract>

		<abstract>Nowadays, there is a growing interest in machine learning and pattern recognition for tree-structured data. Trees actually provide a suitable structural representation to deal with complex tasks such as web information extraction, RNA secondary structure prediction, computer music, or conversion of semi-structured data (e.g. XML documents). Many applications in these domains require the calculation of similarities over pairs of trees.</abstract>
