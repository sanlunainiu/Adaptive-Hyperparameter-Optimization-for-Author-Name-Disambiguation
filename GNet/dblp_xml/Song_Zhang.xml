		<abstract>We present a novel fully automatic method for high res- olution, non-rigid dense 3D point tracking. High qual- ity dense point clouds of non-rigid geometry moving at video speeds are acquired using a phase-shifting structured light ranging technique. To use such data for the temporal study of subtle motions such as those seen in facial expres- sions, an efficient non-rigid</abstract>

		<abstract>Synthesis and re-targeting of facial expressions is central to facial animation and often involves significant manual work in order to achieve realistic expressions, due to the difficulty of capturing high quality dynamic expression data. In this paper we address fundamental issues regarding the use of high quality dense 3-D data samples un- dergoing motions at video speeds, e.g. human facial</abstract>
