		<abstract>New algorithms for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) spectra along different directions are derived and implemented. For computing the DFT spectrum along any given direction (containing N DFT frequencies), a new algorithm is presented that requires N(N-1) additions and a single 1-D FFT. As expected, for a single direction, the directional FFT algorithm is significantly faster than standard 2-D</abstract>
