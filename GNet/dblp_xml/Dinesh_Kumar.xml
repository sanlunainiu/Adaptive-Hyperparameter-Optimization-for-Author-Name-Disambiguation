		<abstract>We consider the problem of optimal next-hop selection in a route between two vehicles, for a simple scenario of Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) on a highway. For a given approximation of the optimal number of hops, we seek the optimal choice of next-hop based on its speed and inter-node distances, so as to maximize the expected route lifetime.

		<abstract>Abstract. With more and more users subscribing to wireless broadband services, it is desirable for them to have access to both WLAN and UMTS networks. We study glob- ally optimal user-network association in an integrated WLAN and UMTS hybrid cell. The association problem is formulated as a generic MDP (Markov Decision Process) connection routing decision problem. In the formulation, mobile</abstract>

		<abstract>The inherent nature of the physical setup and trans- mission mechanism in wireless ad hoc networks with random channel access, results in correlation between the link metrics of adjacent links, when considering path optimization problems. We identify a special structure inherent to the solution of Dynamic Programming (DP) problem arising in such an optimization over paths. According to this structure,</abstract>

		<abstract>In a dense multi-hop network of mobile nodes capa- ble of applying adaptive power control, we consider the problem of finding the optimal hop distance that maximizes a certain throughput measure in bit-metres/sec, subject to average network power constraints. The mobility of nodes is restricted to a circular periphery area centered at the nominal location of nodes. We incorporate only</abstract>

		<abstract>We study optimal user-network association in an integrated 802.11 WLAN and 3G-UMTS hybrid cell. Assuming saturated resource allocation on the downlink of WLAN and UMTS networks and a single QoS class of mobiles arriving at an average location in the hybrid cell, we formulate the problem with two different approaches: Global and Individual optimality. The Globally optimal association is formulated</abstract>

		<title>New Cross-Layer Channel Switching Policy for TCP Transmission on 3G UMTS Downlink</title>

		<abstract>In 3G UMTS, two main transport channels have been provided for downlink data trans- mission: a common FACH channel and a dedicated DCH channel. The performance of TCP in UMTS depends much on the channel switching policy used. In this paper, we propose and analyze three new basic threshold-based channel switching policies for UMTS that we name as QS (Queue</abstract>
