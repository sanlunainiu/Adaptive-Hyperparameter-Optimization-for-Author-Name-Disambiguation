		<abstract>There has been a lot of activity recently surrounding the mosaic representation of video sequences. However, existing mosaic methods have in general a strong limitation. They are prone to converge to a local minimum in least-squares estimation, especially when large image motion exists between two consecutive frames or there are too many outliers, for example, when large moving objects appear</abstract>
