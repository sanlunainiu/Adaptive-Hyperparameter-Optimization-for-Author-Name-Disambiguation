		<abstract>Abstractó A Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is considered with nodes that may act selshly or maliciously by simply dropping data packets rather than forwarding them. We study a distributed route assessment (reputation) system for a MANET context in which nodes attribute a route’s performance to their nearest neighbors on the route. Also, attribution to all relaying nodes is studied for</abstract>
