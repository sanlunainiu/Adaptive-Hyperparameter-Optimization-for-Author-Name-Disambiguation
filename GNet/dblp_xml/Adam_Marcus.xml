		<abstract>To find interesting, personally relevant web content, people rely on friends and colleagues to pass links along as they encounter them. In this paper, we study and augment link- sharing via e-mail, the most popular means of sharing web content today. Armed with survey data indicating that ac- tive sharers of novel web content are often those that active- ly</abstract>

		<abstract>E cient management of RDF data is an important factor in real- izing the Semantic Web vision. Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for RDF data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches.</abstract>

		<abstract>The web has dramatically enhanced people's ability to communicate ideas, knowledge, and opinions. But the authoring tools that most people understand, blogs and wikis, primarily guide users toward authoring text. In this work, we show that substantial gains in expressivity and communication would accrue if people could easily share richly structured information in meaningful visualizations. We then describe several extensions</abstract>

		<abstract>We introduce a client-server toolkit called Sync Kit that demonstrates how client-side database storage can improve the performance of data intensive websites. Sync Kit is designed to make use of the embedded relational database dened in the upcoming HTML5 standard to ooad some data storage and processing from a web server onto the web browsers to which it serves content.</abstract>

		<abstract>The web crawler space is often delimited into two general areas: full-web crawling and focused crawling. We present netSifter, a crawler system which integrates features from these two areas to provide an effective mechanism for web- scale crawling. netSifter utilizes a combination of page-level analytics and heuristics which are applied to a sample of web pages from a given website.</abstract>
