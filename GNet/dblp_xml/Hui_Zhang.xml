		<abstract>Real-time IP flow estimation has many potential applications in network management, monitoring, security, and traffic engineering. Existing techniques typically rely on flow definitions being constrained as subsets of the fields in packet headers. This makes flow-membership tests relatively inexpensive. In this paper, we consider a more general flow estimation problem that needs complex packet-payload based tests for flow-membership. An example</abstract>

We present WireFS, a Wide Area File System, which enables delegation of metadata management to nodes at client sites (homes). The home of a file stores the most recent copy of the file, serializes all updates, and streams updates to the</abstract>

For these reasons, tractography often fails to extract thin tracts with sharp changes in orientation, e.g. the cingulum. Unlike tractography—which</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we present a novel deformable registration algorithm for diffusion tensor MR images that enables explicit optimization of tensor reorientation. The optimization seeks a piecewise affine transformation that divides the image domain into uniform regions and transform each region affinely. The objective function captures both the image similarity and the smoothness of the transformation across region boundaries. The</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract. This paper describes an algorithm for unbiased construction of white matter (WM) atlases using full information available to diusion tensor (DT) images. The key component,of the proposed algorithm is a novel DT image registration method,that leverages metrics comparing tensors as a whole and optimizes tensor orientation explicitly. The problem of unbiased atlas construction is formulated using the approach proposed</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract—This paper presents a novel fuzzy-segmentation method for diffusion tensor (DT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Typical fuzzy-segmentation schemes, e.g., those based on fuzzy C means (FCM), incorporate Gaussian class models that are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal clusters characterized by a mean element and a covariance matrix. Tensors in fiber bundles, however, inherently lie on specific manifolds in Riemannian spaces.</abstract>

		<abstract>Although modern graphics hardware has strong capability to render millions of triangles within a second, huge scenes are still unable to be rendered in real-time. Lots of parallel and distributed graphics systems are explored to solve this problem. However none of them is built for large-scale graphics applications.We designed AnyGL, a large-scale hybrid distributed graphics system, which consists of four</abstract>

		<abstract>We present a novel multi-modal haptic interface for sketching and exploring the structure and properties of mathematical knots. Our interface de- rives from the familiar pencil-and-paper process of drawing 2D knot diagrams to facilitate the creation and exploration of mathematical knots; however, with a touch-based interface, users can also leverage their physical intuition by seeing, touching, and feeling the knots.</abstract>

		<abstract>We present a multimodal paradigm for exploring topological sur- faces embedded in four dimensions; we exploit haptic methods in particular to overcome the intrinsic limitations of 3D graphics im- ages and 3D physical models. The basic problem is that, just as 2D shadows of 3D curves lose structure where lines cross, 3D graph- ics projections of smooth 4D topological surfaces</abstract>

		<abstract>ABSTRACT Just as we can work with two-dimensional oor,plans to communicate 3D architectural design, we can exploit reduced-dimension shadows to manipulate the higher-dimensional objects generating the shadows. In particular, by taking advantage of physically reactive 3D shadow-space controllers, we can transform the task of interacting with 4D objects to a new level of physical reality. We begin with a teaching</abstract>
