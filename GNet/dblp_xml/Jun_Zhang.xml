		<abstract>Development of high throughput data acquisition technolo- gies, together with advances in computing, and communications have resulted in an explosive growth in the number, size, and diversity of potentially useful information sources. This has resulted in unprece- dented opportunities in data-driven knowledge acquisition and decision- making in a number of emerging increasingly data-rich application domains such as bioinformatics, environmental informatics,</abstract>

		<abstract>There is an urgent need for sound approaches to integrative and col- laborative analysis of large, autonomous (and hence, inevitably semantically het- erogeneous) data sources in several increasingly data-rich application domains. In this paper, we precisely formulate and solve the problem of learning classifiers from such data sources, in a setting where each data source has a hierarchical ontology associated</abstract>

		<abstract>Many practical applications of machine learning in data- driven scientiflc discovery commonly call for the exploration of data from multiple points of view that correspond to explicitly specifled ontolo- gies. This paper formalizes a class of problems of learning from ontology and data, and explores the design space of learning classiflers from at- tribute value taxonomies (AVTs) and data. We</abstract>

		<abstract>Attribute Value Taxonomies (AVT) have been shown to be useful in constructing compact, robust, and comprehen- sible classifiers. However, in many application domains, human-designed AVTs are unavailable. We introduce AVT- Learner, an algorithm for automated construction of at- tribute value taxonomies from data. AVT-Learner uses Hi- erarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) to cluster at- tribute values based on the distribution of</abstract>

		<abstract>In many machine learning applications that deal with se- quences, there is a need for learning algorithms that can effectively utilize the hierarchical grouping of words. We introduce Word Taxonomy guided Naive Bayes Learner for the Multinomial Event Model (WTNBL-MN) that exploits word taxonomy to generate compact classifiers, and Word Taxonomy Learner (WTL) for automated construction of word taxon- omy</abstract>

		<abstract>We consider classiflcation problems in which the class labels are organized into an abstraction hierarchy in the form of a class taxon- omy. We deflne a structured label classiflcation problem. We explore two approaches for learning classiflers in such a setting. We also develop a class of performance measures for evaluating the resulting classiflers. We present preliminary results that demonstrate</abstract>

		<abstract>Most learning algorithms for data-driven induction of pat- tern classifiers (e.g., the decision tree algorithm), typically represent in- put patterns at a single level of abstraction - usually in the form of an ordered tuple of attribute values. However, in many applications of in- ductive learning - e.g., scientific discovery, users often need to explore a data set at multiple</abstract>
