		<abstract>Transmembrane proteins affect vital cellular functions and diseases, and are a focus of drug design. It is difficult to obtain diffraction quality crystals to study transmembrane protein structure. Computational tools for transmembrane protein topology prediction fill in the gap between the abundance of transmembrane proteins and the scarcity of known membrane protein structures. Their prediction accuracy is still inadequate: TMHMM</abstract>

		<abstract>Spatial allocation is the process of assigning different attributes (e.g., land-use or land-cover) to spatial entities (e.g., map polygons or grid cells). It is an exercise that often requires the analysis of multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives. Multi-objective spatial allocation problems often exhibit substantial computational complexity, especially when spatial pattern characteristics are specified as the allocation objectives. Optimization techniques that incorporate</abstract>
