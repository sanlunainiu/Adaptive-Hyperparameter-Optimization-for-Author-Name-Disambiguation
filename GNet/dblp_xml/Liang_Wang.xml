		<abstract>This paper provides a new perspective on human mo- tion analysis, namely regarding human motions in video as general discrete time signals. While this seems an intuitive idea, research on human motion analysis has attracted lit- tle attention from the signal processing community.

		<abstract>We describe a probabilistic framework for recognizing human activities in monocular video based on simple silhouette observations in this paper. The methodology combines kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) based feature extraction and factorial conditional random field (FCRF) based motion modeling. Silhouette data is represented more compactly by nonlinear dimensionality reduction that explores the underlying structure of the articulated action space</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we formulate an algorithm for the stereo matching problem with careful handling of disparity, dis- continuity and occlusion. The algorithm works with a global matching stereo model based on an energy- minimization framework. The global energy contains two terms, the data term and the smoothness term. The data term is first approximated by a color-weighted correlation, then</abstract>

		<abstract>Time-of-flight range sensors have error characteristics which are complementary to passive stereo. They provide real time depth estimates in conditions where passive stereo does not work well, such as on white walls. In contrast, these sensors are noisy and often perform poorly on the tex- tured scenes for which stereo excels. We introduce a method for combining the results from</abstract>

		<abstract>Many vision applications require high-accuracy dense disparity maps in real-time and online. Due to time constraint, most real-time stereo applications rely on local winner-takes-all optimization in the disparity computation process. These local approaches are generally outperformed by offline global optimization based algorithms. However, recent research shows that, through carefully selecting and aggregating the matching costs of neighboring pixels, the disparity</abstract>
