		<abstract>Situational awareness of urban flooding during storm events is important for disaster and emergency management. However, no general purpose tools yet exist for rendering rainfall accumulations in real-time at the resolution of hydrologic units used for modeling. This demonstration will exhibit a novel web 2.0 visual analytical approach for understanding and adaptively managing urban flooding issues. The approach generates a</abstract>

		<abstract>In this demonstration paper, we describe the technologies and implementations that allow near real-time creation of new virtual precipitation sensors using NEXRAD Level II streaming data at user-specified point locations and time intervals in an integrated digital watershed with a Google Map-based web interface. The spatiotemporal and thematic transformation steps to produce such new time series data stream are implemented</abstract>
