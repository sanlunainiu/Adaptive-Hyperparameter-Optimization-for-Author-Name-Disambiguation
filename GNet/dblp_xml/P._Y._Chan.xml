		<abstract>In spite of much research effort, there is no universally applicable software reliability growth model which can be trusted to give accurate predictions of reliability in all circumstances. Worse, we are not even in a position to be abl_ to decide a priori which of the many models is most suitable in a particular context. Our own r_ecent work has</abstract>
