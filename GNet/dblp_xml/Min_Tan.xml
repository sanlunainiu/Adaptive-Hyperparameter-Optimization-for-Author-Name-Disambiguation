		<abstract>An important problem in heterogeneous computing (HC) is predicting task execution time. A methodology is introduced for determining the execution time distribution for a given data parallel program that is to be executed in an SIMD, MIMD (SPMD), and/or mixed-mode SIMD/MIMD (SPMD) HC environment. The program is assumed to contain operations and constructs whose execution times depend on input-data values.</abstract>

		<abstract>In a dedicated mixed-machine heterogeneous computing (HC) system, an application pro- gram may be decomposed into subtasks, then each subtask assigned to the machine where it is best suited for execution. Data relocation is defined as selecting the sources for needed data items. It is assumed that multiple independent subtasks of an application program can be exe- cuted concurrently on</abstract>

		<abstract>In a heterogeneous computing (HC) environment consisting of different types of machines, an application program is decomposed into subtasks, each of which is computationally homogeneous. The goal is to execute subtasks on the machines in such a way that the total program execution time is minimized. A mathematical framework is presented that models the matching of subtasks to machines, scheduling</abstract>
