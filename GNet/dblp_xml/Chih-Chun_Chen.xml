		<abstract>The vertex correspondence establishment among multiple objects is a versatile operation in computer graphics and geometry processing. We propose a systematic method called recursive quinary subdivision to efficiently find a dissection for a meshed object of genus-zero with little user input. The process can be easily extended to multiple objects, taking into account the alignment of extra feature points for</abstract>

		<abstract>We present a hybrid rendering scheme that explores the locality of visibility at the cost of extra storage and prefetching, and makes a tradeoff between image quality and rendering efficiency by using textured level-of-detail (LOD) meshes. The space is first subdivided into cells. For each cell, inside objects are rendered as normal while outside objects are rendered as textured LOD</abstract>

		<abstract>Level-of-detail modeling is a vital representation for real-time applications. T o support texture mapping progres- sive meshes (PM), we usually allow the whole PM sequence to share a comm on texture map. Although such a common texture map can be derived by using appropriate mesh paramete rizations that consider the minimization of geometry stretch, texture stretch, or even the texture</abstract>
