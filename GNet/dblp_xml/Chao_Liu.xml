With the motivation of detecting masqueraders on clus- ters, this work seeks to discriminate different types of use rs based on their command behavior - in particular, user com- mand behavior on a multi-user public machine versus</abstract>

		<abstract>We study a novel problem of mining significant recurrent rules from a sequence database. Recurrent rules have the form &quot;when- ever a series of precedent events occurs, eventually a series of consequent events occurs&quot;. Recurrent rules are intuitive and characterize behaviors in many domains. An example is in the domain of software specifications, in which the rules capture a family</abstract>

Fault localization aims at automatically locating likely fault locations, and hence assists manual debugging. A number of fault localization algorithms have been developed in recent years, which prove effec- tive when multiple failing and passing</abstract>

		<abstract>It has been almost two decades since the first globally tracking con- vergent adaptive controllers were derived for robot with dynamic uncertainties. However, the problem of concurrent adaptation to both kinematic and dynamic uncertainties has never been system- atically solved. This is the subject of this paper. We derive a new adaptive Jacobian controller for trajectory tracking of robot with</abstract>
