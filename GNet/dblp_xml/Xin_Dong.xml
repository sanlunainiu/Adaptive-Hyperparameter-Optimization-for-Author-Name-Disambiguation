Volumetric features are neeessary in automated process planning for relating a feature to the extent of ma- terial to be removed from a ~ and for capturing the global chamcteristics of a part, such as tool accessibility.

		<abstract>This work presents an application case study. Geant4 is a 750,000 line toolkit rst designed in the mid-1990s and originally intended only for sequential computation. Intel's promise of an 80-core CPU meant that Geant4 users would have to struggle in the future with 80 processes on one CPU chip, each one having a gigabyte memory footprint. Thread parallelism would be</abstract>

		<abstract>ILU(k) is an important preconditioner widely used in many linear algebra solvers for sparse matrices. Unfortunately, there is still no highly scalable parallel ILU(k) algorithm. This paper presents the first such scalable algorithm. For example, the new algor ithm achieves 50 times speedup with 80 nodes for general sparse matrices of dimension 160,000 that are diagonally dominant. The algorithm assumes</abstract>
