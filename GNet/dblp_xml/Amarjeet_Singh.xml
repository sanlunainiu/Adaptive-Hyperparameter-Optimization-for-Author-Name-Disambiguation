		<abstract>Design of efficient System-on-Chips (SoCs) require thor- ough application analysis to identify various compute inten- sive parts. These compute intensive parts can be mapped to hardware in order to meet the cost as well as the perfor- mance constraints. However, faster time to market requires automation of synthesis of these code segments of the ap- plication from high level specification</abstract>

		<abstract>Summary. This paper reports the first application of iterative experi mental design methodol- ogy for high spatiotemporal resolution characterization of river and lake aquatic systems per- formed using mobile robot sensing systems. Both applications involve dynamic phenomena spread over large spatial domain: 1) Characterization of contaminant concentration and flow at the confluence of two major rivers displaying dynamics due to</abstract>

		<abstract>Distributed, high-density spatiotemporal observa- tions are proposed for answering many river related questions, including those pertaining to hydraulics and multi-dimensional river modeling, geomorphology, sediment transport and ripar- ian habitat restoration. In spite of the recent advancements in technology, currently available systems have many constraints that preclude long term, remote, autonomous, high resolution monitoring in the real environment.

		<abstract>In many sensing applications, including environmental monitoring, measurement systems must cover a large space with only limited sensing resources. One approach to achieve required sensing coverage is to use robots to convey sensors within this space.Planning the motion of these robots - coordinating their paths in order to maxi- mize the amount of information collected while placing bounds on their</abstract>

		<abstract>Many robotic path planning applications, such as search and rescue, involve uncertain environments with complex dynamics that can be only partially observed. When selecting the best subset of ob- servation locations subject to constrained resources (such as limited time or battery capacity) it is an im- portant problem to trade off exploration (gathering information about the environment) and exploita- tion</abstract>

		<abstract>A broad range of embedded networked sensor (ENS) systems for critical environmental monitoring applications now require complex, high peak power dissipating sensor devices, as well as on-demand high performance computing and high bandwidth communication. Embedded computing demands for these new platforms include support for computationally intensive image and signal processing as well as optimization and statistical computing.

		<abstract>Many environmental applications require high fre- quency, spatiotemporally distributed phenomena to be sampled with high fidelity. This requires mobile sensing elements to perform guided sampling in regions of high variability. We propose here a multiscale approach for efficiently sampling such phenomena. This approach introduces a hierarchy of sensors according to the sampling fidelity, spatial coverage and mobility characteristics. In this</abstract>

		<abstract>The need for efficient monitoring of spatio-temporal dynamics in large environmental applica- tions, such as the water quality monitoring in rivers and lakes, motivates the use of robotic sensors in order to achieve sufficient spatial coverage. Typically, these robots have bounded resources, such as limited battery or limited amounts of time to obtain measurements. Thus, careful coordination of their paths</abstract>
