		<abstract>We present a higher-level visual representation, visual synset, for object categorization. The visual synset im- proves the traditional bag of words representation with bet- ter discrimination and invariance power. First, the ap- proach strengthens the inter-class discrimination power by constructing an intermediate visual descriptor, delta visual phrase, from frequently co-occurring visual word-set with similar spatial context. Second, the approach achieves</abstract>

		<abstract>Modeling and recognizing landmarks at world-scale is a useful yet challenging task. There exists no readily avail- able list of worldwide landmarks. Obtaining reliable visual models for each landmark can also pose problems, and ef- ficiency is another challenge for such a large scale system. This paper leverages the vast amount of multimedia data on the web, the availability of</abstract>

		<abstract>Active statistical models including active shape models and active appearance models are very powerful for face alignment. They are composed of two parts: the subspace model(s) and the search process. While these two parts are closely correlated, existing efforts treated them sepa- rately and had not considered how to optimize them over- all. Another problem with the subspace model(s) is</abstract>

		<abstract>A typical automatic face recognition system is composed of three parts: face detection, face alignment and face recognition. Conventionally, these three parts are processed in a bottom-up manner: face detection is performed first, then the results are passed to face alignment, and finally to face recognition. The bottom-up approach is one extreme of vision approaches. The other extreme approach is</abstract>

		<abstract>Active Appearance Models (AAM) is very powerful for extracting objects, e.g. faces, from images. It is composed of two parts: the AAM subspace model and the AAM search. While these two parts are closely correlated, existing ef- forts treated them separately and had not considered how to optimize them overall. In this paper, an approach is pro- posed to optimize</abstract>

		<abstract>Efficient 3D face reconstruction is very important for face animation and recognition. The slow speed of the 3D morphable model is due to the texture mapping. To improve the speed, we only use the shape matching to recover the 3D shape and use texture mapping to get the texture. However, only with the shape information, one image is not enough</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we present a model based on a multi-resolution, multi-source and multi-modal (M3) bootstrapping framework that exploits knowledge of sub-domains for concept detection in news video. Because the characteristics and distributions of data in different sub-domains are different, we model and analyze the video in each sub-domain separately using a transductive framework. Along with this framework, we propose</abstract>

		<abstract>We present a technical demonstration of a world-scale touristic landmark recognition engine. To build such an engine, we leverage ~21.4 million images, from photo sharing websites and Google Image Search, and around two thousand web articles to mine the landmark names and learn the visual models. The landmark recognition engine incorporates 5312 landmarks from 1259 cities in 144 countries. This</abstract>

		<abstract>Person identification is very important in the domain of multimedia news as it is often the focus of events in news stories and interest of searchers. However, this detection is impeded by the imprecise audio/visual analysis tools. In this paper, we describe a multimodal and multi-faceted approach to Person-X detection in news video. We make use of multimodal features extracted</abstract>
