		<abstract>With ever-increasing power density and cooling costs in modern high-performance systems, dynamic thermal management (DTM) has emerged as an effective technique for guaranteeing thermal safety at run-time. While past works on DTM have focused on different techniques in isolation, they fail to consider a synergistic mechanism using both hardware and software support and hence lead to a significant execution time</abstract>

		<abstract>As processor core counts increase, networks-on-chip (NoCs) are becoming an increasingly popular interconnec- tion fabric due to their ability to supply high bandwidth. However, NoCs need to deliver this high bandwidth at low latencies, while keeping within a tight power envelope. In this paper, we present a novel NoC with hybrid interconnect that leverages multiple types of interconnects√±specically , conventional</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract As chip multiprocessors (CMPs) become,the only viable way to scale up and utilize the abundant transistors made available in current microprocessors, the design of on-chip networks is becoming,critically important. These networks face unique design constraints and are required to provide extremely fast and high bandwidth communication, yet meet tight power and area budgets. In this paper, we present a</abstract>

		<abstract>With the advent of chip multiprocessors (CMPs) in main- stream systems, the on-chip network that connects different processing cores becomes a critical part of the design. There has been significant work in the recent past on designing these networks for efficiency and scalability. However, most net- work design evaluations use a stand-alone network simulator which fails to capture the system-level</abstract>

		<abstract>ABSTRACT Due to wire delay scalability and bandwidth,limitations inherent in shared buses and dedicated links, packet-switched on-chip interconnection networks are fast emerging as the pervasive communication fabric to connect dieren t processing elements in many-core chips. However, current state-ofthe-art packet-switched networks rely on complex routers which increases the communication overhead and energy consumption as compared,to the ideal interconnection fabric.

		<abstract>Due to the wire delay constraints in deep submicron technology and increasing demand for on-chip bandwidth, networks are becoming the pervasive interconnect fabric to connect processing elements on chip. With ever-increasing power density and cooling costs, the thermal impact of on-chip networks needs to be urgently addressed. In this work, we first characterize the thermal profile of the MIT Raw</abstract>
