		<abstract>Dynamic branch predictor logic alone accounts for approx- imately 10% of total processor power dissipation. Recent research indi- cates that the power cost of a large dynamic branch predictor is oset by the power savings created by its increased accuracy. We describe a method of reducing dynamic predictor power dissipation without de- grading prediction accuracy by using a combination of</abstract>
