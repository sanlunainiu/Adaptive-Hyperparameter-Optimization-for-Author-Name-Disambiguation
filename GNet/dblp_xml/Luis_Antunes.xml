		<abstract>Access control to Electronic Patient Records (EPR) may greatly depend on users' objectives and needs. The purpose of this study is to assess the opinions of medical doctors within a university hospital towards access control to an EPR. We selected a randomized sample of 58 doctors from a university hospital and 45 structured interviews were applied. 42 respondents (93%) agree</abstract>

		<abstract>Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring, before and during labor, is a very important medical practice in the detection of fetuses in danger. We clustered FHR tracings by compression in order to identify abnormal ones. We use a recently introduced approach based on algorithmic information theory, a theoretical, rigorous and well-studied notion of information content in individual objects. The new method</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract Kolmogorov complexity measures the ammount,of information in a string as the size of the shortest program,that computes the string. The Kolmogorov structure function divides the smallest program producing a string in two parts: the useful information present in the string, called sophistication if based on total functions, and the remaining accidental information. We formalize a connection between sophistication (due</abstract>

		<abstract>Depth of an object concerns a tradeoff between computation time and excess of pro- gram length over the shortest program length required to obtain the object. It gives an unconditional lower bound on the computation time from a given program in absence of auxiliary information. Variants known as logical depth and computational depth are expressed in Kolmogorov complexity theory. We</abstract>
