		<abstract>Low latency anonymity systems are susceptive to traffic anal- ysis attacks. In this paper, we propose a dependent link padding scheme to protect anonymity systems from traffic analysis attacks while providing a strict delay bound. The covering traffic generated by our scheme uses the minimum sending rate to provide full anonymity for a given set of flows. The relationship between</abstract>

		<abstract>Coverage is a very important issue in wireless sensor net- works. Current literature defines a point to be covered if it is within the sensing radius of at least one sensor. This is a conservative definition of coverage and we have previously proposed a new notion of information coverage. Compared with the conventional definition of coverage, a point can still</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper we consider the coverage problem for target detection applications in wireless sensor networks. Unlike conventional coverage problems which assume sensing regions are disks around sensors, we define the sensing region according to detection constraints in terms of false alarm probability and missing probability. We show that exploiting cooperation between sensors can extend the overall sensing region while</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper, we study the coverage problem for hybrid networks which comprise both static and mobile sensors. We consider mobile sensors with limited mobility, i.e., they can move only once over a short distance. Such mobiles are simple and cheap compared to sophisticated mobile robots. In conventional static sensor networks, for a random deployment, the sensor density should increase</abstract>

		<abstract>In many delay tolerant applications, information is opportunistically exchanged between mobile devices who encounter each other. In order to effect such information exchange, mobile devices must have knowledge of other devices in their vicinity. We consider scenarios in which there is no infrastructure and devices must probe their environment to discover other devices. This can be an extremely energy consuming</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract. Recently, great efforts have been dedicated to researches on the management of large scale graph based data such as WWW, social networks, biological networks. In the study of graph based data management, node disjoint subgraph homeomorphism relation between graphs is more suitable than (sub)graph isomorphism in many cases, especially in those cases that node skipping and node mismatching,are allowed.</abstract>

		<abstract>Mining frequent structural patterns from graph databases is an interesting problem with broad applications. Most of the previous studies focus on pruning unfruitful search subspaces effectively, but few of them address the mining on large, disk-based databases. As many graph databases in applications cannot be held into main memory, scalable mining of large, disk-based graph databases remains a challenging problem.</abstract>

		<abstract>Recently, there is an increasing interest in new intelligent mining methods to find more meaningful and compact results. In intelligent data mining research, accessing the quality and usefulness of the results from different mining methods is essential. However, there is no general benchmarking criteria to evaluate whether these new methods are indeed more effec- tive compared to the traditional methods.</abstract>

		<abstract>Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for multi-criteria decision making, data mining and visualization, and user-preference queries. In this paper. we consider the problem of efficiently computing a SKYCUBE, which consists of skylines of all possible non-empty subsets of a given set of dimensions. While existing skyline computation algorithms can be immediately extended to computing each skyline query</abstract>

		<abstract>Recent Advances in Distributed Source Coding (DSC) motivate the mission-driven wireless sensor network application that relates to compression of multiple correlated sensor outputs, such as real time target tracking and environment monitoring. The characteristic of multiple rates in DSC applications requires the associated sensor network to support Rate-Oriented Routing (ROR) in order to extend the network life time. In this</abstract>

		<abstract>In this work, we propose a scheme for joint blind source separation (BSS) of multiple datasets using canonical corre- lation analysis (CCA). The proposed scheme jointly extracts sources from each dataset in the order of between-set source correlations. We show that, when sources are uncorrelated within each dataset and correlated across different datasets only on corresponding indices, (i) CCA on</abstract>

		<abstract>We present a data-driven approach for target detection and identification based on a linear mixture model. Our aim is to determine the existence of certain targets in a mixture without specific information on the targets or the background, and to identify the targets from a given library. We use the maximum canonical correlation between the target set and the observa-</abstract>

		<abstract>A detection approach, detection with a correlation bound (DCB), is introduced based on a linear mixture model. We use the upper bound of the correlation between the target and mixing components as the detection index, and derive the expression for this correlation bound using the observed data. The proposed method is an unsupervised approach and provides satisfactory detection performance without</abstract>

		<abstract>We introduce non-negative matrix factorization with orthogonality constraints (NMFOC) for detection of a target spectrum in a given set of Raman spectra data. An orthogonality measure is defined and two different orthogonality constraints are imposed on the standard NMF to incorporate prior information into the estimation and hence to facilitate the subsequent detection procedure. Both multiplicative and gradient type update</abstract>
