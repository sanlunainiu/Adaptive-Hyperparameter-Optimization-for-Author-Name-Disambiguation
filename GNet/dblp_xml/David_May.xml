		<abstract>This paper outlines the application of a knowledge-based expert system to assist the furnace production staff in diagnosing and correcting Electron Beam (EB) guns, which are used to melt titanium. The characteristics of a titanium melting facility, its business objectives, and the responsibilities of its furnace operators are reviewed. Alternative solutions to the problem of accurately troubleshooting EB gun failures</abstract>
