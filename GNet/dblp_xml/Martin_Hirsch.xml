		<abstract>This paper discusses systematic approaches to the design of distributed controllers in industrial automation systems. Several design approaches are compared that lead to the distributed control of manufacturing machines and their parts. In particular, a decentralized control method is introduced that does not require a master controller. The implementation frameworks of IEC 61131-3 and IEC 61499 are checked on their</abstract>
