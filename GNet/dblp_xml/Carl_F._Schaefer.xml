		<abstract>Motivation: Sites with substantive bioinformatics operations are challenged to build data processing and delivery infrastruc- ture that provides reliable access and enables data integration. Locally generated data must be processed and stored such that relationships to external data sources can be presen- ted. Consistency and comparability across data sets requires annotation with controlled vocabularies and, further, metadata standards for data</abstract>

		<abstract>The Pathway Interaction Database (PID, http://pid. nci.nih.gov) is a freely available collection of curated and peer-reviewed pathways composed of human molecular signaling and regulatory events and key cellular processes. Created in a collaboration between the US National Cancer Institute and Nature Publishing Group, the database serves as a research tool for the cancer research community and others interested in cellular</abstract>
