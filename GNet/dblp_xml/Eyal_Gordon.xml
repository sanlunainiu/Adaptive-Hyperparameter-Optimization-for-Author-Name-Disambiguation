		<abstract>We discuss the synthesis between the 3D and the 2D data in three-dimensional face recognition. We show how to com- pensate for the illumination and facial expressions using the 3D facial geometry and present the approach of canonical images, which allows to incorporate geometric information into standard face recognition approaches.</abstract>
