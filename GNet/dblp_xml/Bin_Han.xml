		<abstract>Abstract. In this paper, we present a necessary and su‐cient condition for the existence of solutions in a Sobolev space W 0. This paper generalizes the results in [R. Q. Jia, K. S. Lau, and D. X. Zhou, J. Fourier Anal. Appl., 7 (2001), pp. 143{167] in the univariate setting to the multivariate setting.</abstract>

		<abstract>Abstract: It is well known that in the univariate case, up to an integer shift andpossible sign change, there is no dyadic compactly supported symmetric orthonormalscaling function except for the Haar function. In this paper we are concerned with theconstruction of symmetric orthonormal scaling functions with dilation factor d = 4.Several examples of such scaling functions are provided in this</abstract>

		<abstract>For prescribed values of a function and its partial derivatives of orders 1 and 2 at the vertices of a square, we flt an interpolating surface. We investigate two families of solutions provided by two Hermite subdivision schemes, denoted HD2 and HR2. Both schemes depend on 2 matrix parameters, a square matrix of order 2 and a square matrix of</abstract>

		<abstract>Multiwavelets are generated from refinable function vectors by using multiresolution analysis. In this paper we investigate the approximation properties of a multivariate refinable function vector associated with a general dilation matrix in terms of both the subdivision operator and the order of sum rules satisfied by the matrix refinement mask. Based on a fact about the sum rules of biorthogonal</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper we shall study vector cascade algorithms and refinable function vectors with a general isotropic dilation matrix in Sobolev spaces. By investigating several properties of the initial function vectors in a vector cascade algorithm, we are able to take a relatively unified approach to study several questions such as convergence, rate of convergence and error estimate for a</abstract>

		<abstract>We introduce a general denition of renable Hermite interpolants and investigate their general properties. We also study a notion of symmetry of these renable interpolants. Results and ideas from the extensive theory of general renement equations are applied to obtain results on renable Hermite interpolants. The theory developed here is constructive and yields an easy- to-use construction method for multivariate</abstract>

		<abstract>In this paper we study a simple oversampled analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion in shift invariant spaces. The Beurling-Landau type theo- rem for bandlimited signal spaces is extended to shift invariant spaces, and then a non-uniform sampling theorem for shift invariant spaces is established, which says, a uniformly discrete set is a stable sampling set for a shift invariant space if its</abstract>

		<abstract>An ideal analog-to-digital (A/D) converter prefilters a signal by an ideal lowpass filter. Recent research on A/D conversion based on shift- invariant spaces reveals that prefiltering signals by quasiprojections into shift-invariant spaces provides more flexible choices in designing an A/D conversion system of high accuracy. This paper focuses on the accuracy of such prefiltering, in which the aliasing error is</abstract>
