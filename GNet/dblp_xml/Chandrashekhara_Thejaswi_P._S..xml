		<abstract>Distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS) is studied for wireless ad-hoc networks in which many links contend for the channel using random access before data transmissions. Simply put, DOS involves a process of joint channel probing and distributed scheduling for ad-hoc (peer-to- peer) communications. Since in practice, link conditions are estimated with noisy observations, the transmission rate has to be backed off</abstract>
