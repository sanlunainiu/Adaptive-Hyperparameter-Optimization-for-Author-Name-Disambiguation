		<abstract>Independent component analysis (ICA) is a technique to separate the mixed signal into independent components without priori assumptions about the hemodynamic response to the task. Spatial ICA (SICA) is applied widely in fMRI data because the spatial dimension of fMRI data is larger than their tem- poral dimension. The general linear model (GLM) is based on a priori knowl- edge</abstract>
