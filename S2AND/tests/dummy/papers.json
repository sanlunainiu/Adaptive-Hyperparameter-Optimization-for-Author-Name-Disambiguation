        "title": "Teach graphics using excel in place of a graphing calculator",
        "abstract": "Excel spreadsheets were developed to teach the underlying math in a computer graphics course including reviewing basic linear algebra operations, tracing a series of OpenGL transformations, and creating Bezier curves and surfaces with forward differences. Each spreadsheet contains an English overview of the mathematical process and the numerical result of each sub step thus providing a high level of abstraction. Double clicking a numerical result shows the underlying equation and operands used. The authors recommend using Excel in place of a graphing calculator in a computer graphics course.",

        "title": "Objects first using Alice to introduce object constructs in CS1",
        "abstract": "Java has become the programming language of choice for the first computer programming course in most of the computer science programs in the country. However, Java is a true objected-oriented language and requires instructors to introduce object-oriented constructs (classes, objects and methods) early in the course. This poses a problem for both students (who find the introduction to objects to be very dry and abstract) and instructors (who attempt to enliven this material). In this paper, the authors describe how Alice is used to introduce the essential concepts of object-oriented programming in the beginning of a CS1 Java course.",

One course teaches how to use Microsoft Office and is a service course. The other teaches Computer Graphics to computer science majors. The internet materials are structured to use each of the three student learning styles: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. The steps the authors used to create the internet materials with Adobe Captivate© are presented and parts of a sample lecture are available for download.",
